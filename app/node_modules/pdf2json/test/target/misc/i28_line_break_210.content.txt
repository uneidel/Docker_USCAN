2.4.2.  A former member of the armed forces who is a Medal of Honor recipient and who is not  otherwise  entitled  to  medical  and  dental  benefits  as  a  retiree  will  be  given  medical  and

----------------Page (16) Break----------------
  18  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
2.6.1.  Healthcare for Service Academy cadets and Midshipmen is generally limited to MTF direct care.  Enrollment into TRICARE is not authorized.  Required healthcare that exceeds 
an MTF‘s capabilities is usually authorized and arranged by the MTF Referral Management Center similarly to the process used for Reserve Component members with In-Line-of-Duty 
injuries  and/or  illnesses.    Referral  to  another  MTF  or  a  civilian  network  or  non-network provider may be authorized. 
2.7.  Former Active Duty Female Service Members – Obstetrical/Maternity Healthcare. 2.7.1.  Female  Uniformed  Service  Members  discharged  or  separated  from  Military  Service 
under  Honorable  conditions  or  in  association  with  a  General  Discharge,  occurring  Under Honorable Conditions, and who are or have been determined to be pregnant prior to Service 
separation or discharge, may be authorized OB/maternity-related direct care (if available) at an  Air  Force  MTF  only  after  obtaining  the  MTF  Commander‘s  permission.    Service 
Members  separating  or  receiving  a  discharge  under  other  circumstances  (e.g.,  involuntary separation under Honorable conditions not already covered by TAMP), who seek MTF direct 
healthcare,  may  be  eligible  for  specific  MTF  care  under  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force Designee Program (10 U.S.C. § 8013). 
2.7.2.  Former  female  Service  Members  seeking  continued  MTF  direct  care  under  this provision  must  not  be  eligible  for  MHS  or  direct  MTF  care  under  another  higher  priority 
beneficiary  category.    For  example,  in  the  case  of  a  dual  military,  opposite  sex,  married couple;  following  military  service  separation  or  discharge,  a  former  ADSM  female  is  not 
authorized  healthcare  under  this  provision  if  she  is  already  authorized  healthcare  benefits under her spouse‘s (sponsor‘s) healthcare entitlement. 
2.7.3.  Former  female  ADSMs  discharged  under  Other-Than-Honorable  conditions  may  be eligible for direct MTF care when authorized by a General Court-Martial Authority and only 
when approved by an Air Force MTF Commander. 2.7.4.  MTF  direct  care  is  generally  not  extended  to  former  female  ADSMs  who  receive 
uncharacterized, entry-level, administrative separations or discharges when determined (by a military  provider)  the  female  ADSM  is  or  was  immediately  pregnant  prior  to  Service 
enlistment  or  appointment.  MTF  direct  care  is  generally  not  authorized  for  former  female ADSMs who become pregnant during the entry-level Service period when Service separation 
or discharge characterization is not typically granted or provided. 2.7.5.  Individuals  who  are married  to  an  ADSM  should  not  apply  for  benefits  under  this 
paragraph since they are authorized care as a family member. 2.7.6.  Individuals  must  present  a  DD  Form  214,  Discharge  Certificate,  or  other  official 
discharge  documents  that  reflect  the  Service  characterization,  to  apply  for  care  under  this section. 
2.7.7.  Obstetrical/maternity care described under this section is authorized for former female ADSMs  and  RCSMs  who  became  pregnant  prior  to  being  discharged  or  relieved  from 
Extended Active Duty (EAD). 2.7.7.1.  Obstetrical/maternity  care  is  unauthorized  after  the  female  Service  Member  is 
released  from  Inactive  Duty  Training  (IDT),  Active  Duty  for  Training  (ADT),  Annual Tour  (AT),  or  Temporary  Tour  of  Active  Duty  (TTAD).    Former female  ADSMs  who 
----------------Page (17) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   19  
become   pregnant   while   entitled   to   Transitional   Assistance   Management   Program (TAMP) are not eligible for care under this program.  See paragraph 2.47. for definitive 
TAMP eligibility information. 2.7.8.  Medical  care  is  limited  to obstetrical  (OB)  care  only  at  MTFs  with  OB  capabilities.  
Obstetrical/maternity care shall not be extended to individuals who are already covered under another insurance plan where OB care is offered.  This benefit does not apply to MTFs with 
external resource sharing agreements. 2.7.9.  Healthcare  benefits  approved  by  the  MTF  Commander  and  provided  under  this 
section,  do  not  extend  to  the  TRICARE  program.    Healthcare  is  limited  to  available  MTF prenatal OB care and infant delivery, as well as required medically necessary follow-up care, 
not  to  exceed  six  weeks  post-partum.    In  cases  where  complications  arise  and  the  patient requires  definitive  MTF  inpatient  care  following  delivery,  provide  the  required  healthcare.  
Discontinue  care  or  transfer  the patient  to  an  appropriate  civilian  MTF  after  the  six-week post-partum  period  or  when  the  patient  is  stable  enough  to  transfer.    If  complications  were 
the  result  of  MTF  intervention  during  treatment  of  the  patient,  continued  care  may  be considered under the Secretary of the Air Force Designee program.  Designee status may be 
applied  in  accordance  with  Chapter  4,  Section  4E,  under the provisions  of  "Best  Interest  of the  Air  Force."    The  MTF  Commander  is  responsible  for  ensuring  this  extended  care 
provision is not abused.  Obtaining approved Secretarial Designee status is not guaranteed. 2.7.10.  Individuals  must  request  care  by  applying  to  the  servicing  MTF  Commander.  
Request must include a copy of the individual's DD Form 214 or other official discharge or separation  papers.    If  approved,  inform  the  individual  that  any  maternity  care  in  a  civilian 
medical facility is at her own expense.  Further, if at any time during the management of her maternity  care  it  becomes  necessary  to  transfer  the  patient  to a  civilian  healthcare  facility 
because care required is beyond the capability of the MTF, all costs, to include aeromedical evacuation,  are  charged  to  the  individual.    Before  providing  care,  the  individual  must 
acknowledge  receipt  and  understanding  of  these  provisions  by  signing  a  statement  that explains these facts and includes the following: 
2.7.10.1.  "I  understand  that  if  at  any  time  during  the  management  of  my  healthcare  it becomes necessary for the Air Force MTF to transfer me to a civilian medical facility for 
healthcare beyond the Air Force hospital's capability or capacity, I am responsible for the costs  of  all  civilian  medical  care  provided,  including  transportation  cost  to  the  civilian 
facility."  File a copy of the signed statement in the individual's inpatient health record. 2.7.11.  As soon as possible and/or well in advance of the former ADSM‘s infant delivery at 
the MTF, advise the patient she should apply for Secretarial Designee status for her newborn infant,  otherwise  the  newborn  becomes  a  pay  patient  at  the  Full  Reimbursement  Rate  after 
the six-week post-partum/post-delivery check-up. 2.7.12.  Use of Supplemental Care is limited to diagnostic treatment associated with inpatient 
maternity care when not available in the MTF. 2.7.13.  Post   partum   sterilization   is   authorized   when   performed   during   the   obstetrical 
admission. 2.7.14.  Healthcare   includes   medically   necessary   induced   abortion   within   the   policies 
established by  AFI 44-102 and includes one outpatient examination no later than six weeks 
----------------Page (18) Break----------------
  20  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
after the procedure.  See paragraph 2.54. for more definitive information regarding when an abortion may be performed in an MTF. 
2.7.15.  Reserve  Component  members  who  apply  for  maternity  care  upon  release from  an EAD  period  who  do  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  2.7.7.,  are  advised  that 
continuing  maternity  care  is  not  authorized  at  government  expense  and  that  they  must  seek healthcare from a civilian provider of their choice. 
2.7.16.  Former female   ADSMs  separated  or  discharged  under  Other  Than  Honorable Conditions  (OTHC)  may  be  extended  healthcare  under  this  section  when  the  following 
conditions are met: 2.7.16.1.  When healthcare is authorized under limited approval authority granted by the 
Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF) to  the  General  Court-Martial  Convening  Authority (whether  the  person  was  discharged  IAW  court-martialed  order(s)  or  administratively 
separated)  and  only  when  supported  by  the  MTF  Commander  where  healthcare  is desired.  This limited approval authority is provided to help discharge authorities separate 
individuals  from  Active  Duty  who might  normally  be  maintained  on  Active  duty  solely because  of  pregnancy  and/or  in  the  face  of  evidence  that  would  otherwise  not  result  in 
separation.      The   MTF   Commander   should   provide   supporting   information   to   the convening authority to assist in deliberations, e.g., does the MTF (where care is sought or 
desired  by  the  Service  Member)  have  the  capacity  or  capability  to  provide  OB  care.  Individuals  extended  benefits  under  this  provision  must  be  reported  as  Secretary  of  the 
Air Force Designees annually in the log outlined in Attachment 6, by the medical facility providing treatment.  The following guidelines are used in determining whether to extend 
this benefit: 2.7.16.2.  The care is granted only as an exception, not as a general rule. 
2.7.16.3.  Consideration is given as to whether medical continuity of care is an issue (e.g., the same facility providing prenatal care will also perform delivery). 
2.7.16.4.  Consideration is given as to whether the individual has alternate resources for providing  the care  (e.g.,  child's  father, court  order for  payment  of  maternity  care,  major 
medical  coverage,  other  government  benefits  program,  other  family  members,  and  the general health of the mother). 
2.7.16.5.  Other factors which might be considered reasonable. 2.7.17.  Authority for care of newborn children of women veterans receiving maternity care 
at  Department  of  Veteran  Affairs  (DVA)  facilities,  or  another  facility  pursuant  to  a  DVA contract, is the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Act of 2010, Section 206. 
2.7.18.  Newborn  children  of  women  veterans  receiving  maternity  care  furnished  by  the Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (DVA)  or  another  facility  pursuant  to  a  DVA  contract  for 
services relating to delivery are eligible to receive up to 7 days post-delivery care, including routine care that a newborn would generally require. This impacts those Air Force MTFs that 
have DoD/VA Resource Sharing Agreements for OB care. 2.8.  Retired  members  of  the  Uniformed  Services.  Authority  is  10  U.S.C.  Chapter  55,  31 
U.S.C.  §  1535,  Executive  Order  (EO)  11733.    Provide  healthcare  as  directed  per  statutory requirement.

members  during  this  same  period.    Refer  to  Attachment  25,  Reserve  Healthcare  Eligibility Matrix, Non-Contingency Operations for additional eligibility information. 
2.10.3.  RCSMs  ordered  to  Federal  Active  Duty  for  more  than  30  days  in  support  of contingency  operations  are  also  authorized  full  TRICARE  benefits.    Healthcare  coverage  is 
also extended to each of the RCSM‘s authorized family members.  Additionally,  if  the RCSM is issued delayed-effective-date active duty orders for more than 30 days in support of 
a  contingency  operation,  the  member  and  his  family  members  are  eligible  for  ―early‖ TRICARE  medical  and  dental  benefits  beginning  on  the  latter  of  either:  (a)  the  date  their 
orders were issued or (b) 180 days before the member reports for duty or is ―activated‖ to active  duty.    Refer  to  Attachment  26,  Reserve  Healthcare  Eligibility  Matrix,  Contingency 
Operations for additional eligibility information. 2.10.4.  Outpatient  appointments  must  be  scheduled  and  completed  within  the  time  period

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   23  
connected injury or illness, is authorized.  RCSMs may make medical appointments for duty-related  medical  conditions  regardless  of  their  duty  status  at  the  time  the  appointment  is 
requested.    RCSMs  who  live  in  TRICARE  Prime  Remote  (TPR)  areas  should  obtain  their initial  and/or  completed  LOD  (if  available)  from  their  unit  medical  representative  and 
produce this document when seeking care at an MTF. 2.10.5.  Healthcare  for  non-duty  related  medical  conditions  is  not  authorized  beyond  the 
expiration date of a RCSM‘s orders.  Medications dispensed for non-duty  related  medical conditions should be dispensed in a quantity sufficient to last the duration of the RCSM‘s 
orders or until civilian healthcare can reasonably be obtained after termination of orders. 2.10.6.  RCSMs  on  AD  orders  (except  EAD  or  AGR)  with  non-duty  related  medical

acute exacerbations of pre-existing or non-duty related medical conditions not aggravated by military  service  is  only  authorized  to  prevent  pain  or  undue  suffering  until  the member can 
reasonably be referred to a civilian healthcare provider. 2.10.8.  RCSMs who incur or aggravate a medical condition while performing military duty 
or  traveling  directly  to/from  such  duty  require  a  Line  of  Duty  determination  IAW  AFI  36-2910,  Line  of  Duty  (Misconduct)  Determination,  to  determine  entitlement  to  military 
healthcare while not on active duty orders. 2.10.9.  RCSMs  not  on  active  duty  orders  and  pending  completion  of  a  Line  of  Duty 
investigation  (informal  or  formal)  are  entitled  to  military  healthcare  only  for  the  medical condition under investigation.  The completed 1st page of AF Form 348 or completed blocks 
1-5 on the AFRC Form 348 (both forms must be include provider signatures and dates) are enough  to  justify  treatment  at  government  expense  until  the  Service  Member‘s  unit 
commander  is  able  to  render  a  LOD  decision.    Continued  entitlement  exists  only  if  the medical condition is determined to be In Line of Duty. 
2.10.10.  RCSMs  without  published  orders  are  entitled  to  healthcare  in  military  MTFs  to include referrals to civilian medical facilities as appropriate under the following conditions: 
2.10.10.1.  The RCSM‘s service-connected  medical  condition  is  currently  under  LOD investigation.      Entitlement   exists   only   for   the   healthcare   condition   under   LOD

  24  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
required  to  establish  eligibility.    LOD  is  valid  for  care  only  until  being  found  fit  and returned to duty or separated by the DES system for the documented medical condition. 
2.10.11.  Civilian  Healthcare:  Healthcare  expenses  (to  include  supplemental  care  charges) from civilian healthcare sources are authorized for RCSMs. RCSMs may be authorized initial 
or   emergency   civilian   healthcare   (related   to   an   In-Line-of-Duty   injury   or   illness)   at government expense without pre-approval.  However, follow-up civilian healthcare must be 
pre-approved prior to receiving said care at government expense.  Pre-authorization must be obtained  from  the  military  MTF  referring  the  RCSM  for  civilian  treatment  or  from  the 
MMSO.  Requests for civilian healthcare will be submitted to the MMSO prior to the RCSM receiving said care when not requested through an active duty MTF IAW appropriate RC and 
MMSO guidance. 2.10.12.  Medical  Devices  and/or  Aids:  RCSMs  are  authorized  prosthetic  devices,  hearing

Services.    Military  orthopedic  footwear  may  be  authorized  for  RCSMs  if  required  for  the performance of military duty and the individual is fit for military duty. 
2.10.13.  Pregnancy:  Unless  otherwise  eligible,  pregnant  RCSMs  are  not  provided  delivery services  or  maternity  care  past  the  period  of  their  active  duty  orders.    Pregnant  RCSMs 
ending an EAD or AGR tour receive care IAW paragraphs 2.7.7. and 2.7.7.1. 2.10.13.1.  If  a  RCSM  begins  childbirth  while  on  active  duty  orders  (does  not  include 
Service  Members  on  EAD/AGR  tours)  and  her  orders  terminate  while  in  the  MTF,  she and her newborn are charged the Full Reimbursement Rate (FRR) for each day past the 
expiration  of  orders.    Transfer  the  member  to  a  civilian  medical  facility  as  soon  as possible.  See AFRC 41-104, Pregnancy of Air Force Reserve Personnel. 
2.10.13.2.  If  a  Service  Member  is  hospitalized  for delivery  during  IDT,  charge  the mother and newborn the FRR for the entire period and transfer the mother and child to a 
civilian medical facility as soon as possible. 2.10.13.3.  Reserve   Component   Service   Members   are   not   authorized   issuance   or 
extension  of  orders  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  maternity  care  at  government  expense (including members on active duty orders over 30 days).

2.11.  Physical Examinations & Specialty Consultations. 2.11.1.  General  Eligibility  Rule  (as  applied  to  this  section  only):    Reserve  Component 
Service Members must possess valid published orders at the time of the examination and/or consultation. 
2.11.2.  Physical  Exam:    Reserve  Component  Service  Members  may  receive  a  required periodic physical examination in an active duty MTF at the request of a Reserve Component 
Medical  Unit  (RCMU)  or  RCSM (when  the  Service  Member  has  no  supporting  RCMU).  The request must be submitted to the appropriate MTF Aerospace Medicine or Force Health 
Management  element  in  the  active  duty  MTF.    See  paragraph  2.51.,  Authorization  for Physical  Examinations  Other  than Flying  (including  periodic  examinations)  for  additional 
information. 2.11.3.  Specialty  Consults:    Upon  recommendation  from  a  RCSM‘s  military  medical 
evaluating  provider or  military  medical  evaluating  authority,  RCSMs  are  authorized  care  at active duty  MTFs  to  obtain  specialty  consultation  and/or  diagnostic  laboratory  testing  to 
evaluate abnormal findings found during annual physical examination in order to determine the  member‘s  medical  qualification  for  continued  military  duty  or  continued  special 
operational duty.   If the active duty MTF does not possess the required specialty service or cannot  perform  the  required  laboratory  testing,  the  RCSM  will  be  referred  to  civilian 
healthcare network providers in the same manner as active duty members. 2.11.4.  Referrals:    Reserve  Component  Service  Members who require  follow-up  healthcare 
outside  of  the  area  where  initial  treatment  was  rendered  are  referred  by  the  military  MTF responsible for the Service Member‘s healthcare.  The referring military MTF  contacts  the 
receiving military/civilian MTF to ensure care is delivered.  The referring MTF must notify the RCSM‘s supporting RCMU or the installation Individual Mobility Augmentee (IMA) 
point of contact also referred to as the Base IMA Administrator (BIMAA) for issues related to an IMA. 
2.11.5.  Reserve    Component    Preventive    Health    Assessments:        Preventive    Health Assessments  are  generally  not  considered  comprehensive  physical  exams,  however,  these 
assessments are  critical to identifying potential illnesses or injuries that would otherwise be overlooked and potentially lead to serious future medical issues or result in the member‘s 
inability  to  meet  deployment  requirements.    Members  of  the  RC  are  entitled  to  an  annual PHA.    However,  RCSMs  not  placed  on  active  duty  orders  for  30  days  or  more  are  only 
authorized  MTF  diagnostic  testing  to  evaluate  abnormal  findings  found  during  the  PHA  as long as the necessary testing/care can be provided before the member‘s temporary duty tour 
period  expires.    Any  necessary  follow-up  diagnostic  testing  that  cannot  be  provided  within the RCSM‘s temporary duty period must be obtained from the member‘s own personal 
healthcare  provider.    RCSMs  may  be  placed  on  invitational  travel  orders  for  evaluations required  for  suitability  for  continued  service.    See  AFI  36-2254V1,  Reserve  Personnel 
Participation for additional information. 2.12.  Special Eligibility Considerations. 
2.12.1.  Aircrew:      Reserve   Component   aircrew   members   are   not   normally   entitled   to aerospace clinical services unless on AD orders.  Reserve Component aircrew members not

  26  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
on AD orders may be seen by an AD flight surgeon (FS) for placement on or removal from ―Duty Not Involving Flying‖ (DNIF) status. 
2.12.2.  Dental: Complete elective dental care may not be available during periods of active duty  for  the  correction  of  all  pre-existing  dental  defects.    A  dental  officer  may  elect  to 
provide treatment, but may  also defer such treatment.  Each case is evaluated on individual merit.  The criteria for elective care in one instance may not be valid in another, even though 
the  required  clinical  procedures  are  similar.    Prosthodontic  or  orthodontic  services  may  be provided according to AFI 47-101, Managing Air Force Dental Services.  Members accepted 
for  initiation  of  prosthodontic  or  orthodontic  treatment  must  have  sufficient  active  duty retainability or reasonable expectation that the prescribed treatment can be completed before 
the end of the active duty order.  Continuation of treatment or necessary follow-up for non-duty related conditions are not authorized after expiration of active duty orders. 
2.12.3.  Surgery:  Surgical correction of non-duty related defects while on active duty orders (except EAD or AGR) are not authorized except under conditions where it is required to save 
life,  limb,  sight,  or  prevent  undue  suffering.    If  the  healthcare  condition  is  likely  to  be aggravated  by  or  interfere  with  the  performance  of  military  service,  the  Service  Member 
should  be  referred  back  to  their  RC  unit  commander  for  appropriate  action  and  possible termination of active duty orders. 
2.12.4.  Hospitalization:   Reserve  Component  Service  Members  may  require  hospitalization when  not  on  active  duty  orders.    At  some  point  during  the  hospitalization,  an  LOD 
Determination for Healthcare (1st page of AF Form 348) must be initiated and forwarded to the Service Member‘s supporting RCMU for appropriate processing through the Reserve 
Component  LOD  processing  system.    Reserve  Component  Service  Members  hospitalized beyond  the  termination  date  of  their  AD  orders,  or  while  in  IDT  status  are  entitled  to 
continued military healthcare only for duty related medical conditions, or medical conditions currently undergoing LOD investigation. 
2.12.4.1.  Notify the RCSM‘s unit commander and supporting RCMU when a RCSM is hospitalized.    Contact  RMG/IRMS  for  IMAs  hospitalized  at  DoD  MTFs.    Provide  the 
following  information:    name,  rank,  SSN,  diagnosis,  if  injured  the  nature  of  the  injury, and whether or not the individual is attached to a school for training. 
2.12.5.  Newly  Commissioned  Reserve  Officers - Initial  Active  Duty  TRICARE  Program (RC-IAD).    Authority  is  10  U.S.C.  §  1074(a)(2)(B)(i).    Also  reference  DoDI  7730.54  encl 
17(draft) and National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2004/2006. 2.12.5.1.  This section applies to RCSMs of a Uniformed Service who have been newly 
commissioned  as  Reserve  officers  and  who  also  have  an  approved  request  for  initial Active Duty orders.  Reserve Component members in this category must have either, a) 
orders  that  are  to  be  issued  but  have  not  been  issued,  or  b)  have  been  issued  but  the member  has  not  entered  Active  Duty  yet.    Additionally,  healthcare  eligibility  is  only 
granted  if  the  RCSM  is  not  already  covered  by  another  healthcare  coverage  insurer  or health benefits plan. 
2.12.5.2.  Eligibility is determined by the RCSM‘s servicing personnel component. 2.12.5.3.  If eligible, members are entitled to full medical/dental benefit as Active Duty.

discharge.    Coverage  includes  one  post-partum  visit  (for  the  mother),  one  well-baby examination  and necessary  infant  immunizations  (provided  no  later  than  six  weeks 
following  delivery).    MTF  Commanders  have  the  authority  to  approve  MTF  medical treatment  for  newborn  infants  of  former  Active  Duty  female  service  members.    If  the 
SECDES application is approved by the MTF Commander, charges will be at the Family Member Rate (FMR). 
2.18.1.2.  Aeromedical  evacuation  is  unauthorized.    Government  or  MTF  sponsored transfer  to  another  MTF  is  not  authorized.    Government  or  MTF  sponsored  healthcare

----------------Page (29) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   31  
infant  immunizations  (provided  no  later  than  six  weeks  following  delivery).    MTF Commanders  have  the  authority  to  approve  MTF  direct  care  for  newborn  infants  of 
unmarried  dependent  daughters.  If  SECDES  application  is  approved  by  the  MTF Commander,  charges  will  be  at  the  Family  Member  Rate  (FMR).    There  is  no  sponsor 
service   affiliation   for   DEERS   enrollment,   eligibility,   and   medical   entitlement   for newborns  of  dependent  daughters,  unless,  the  sponsor  qualifies  the  newborn  as  legal 
custody  ward  (with  an  approved  financial  dependency  determination)  or  adoption  per AFI 36-3026V1_IP. 
2.18.2.2.  Aeromedical  evacuation  is  unauthorized.    Government  or  MTF  sponsored transfer  to  another  MTF  is  not  authorized.    Government  or  MTF  sponsored  healthcare 
coverage  for  civilian  healthcare  (TRICARE  network  or  non-network  care  included)  is unauthorized. 
2.18.2.3.  Charge  the  FMR  if  sponsor  provides  proof  of  intent  to  adopt  the  newborn within 30 days of delivery. 
2.18.2.4.  The  infant‘s  mother  and  her  sponsor  must  be  informed  that  any  newborn healthcare received in a civilian medical facility will be at the expense of the sponsor or 
the family and not the government.  Ensure that the mother (if older than 18 years of age) and  sponsor  sign  a  memorandum  acknowledging  the  possibility  of  associated  costs  for 
civilian care.  The infant‘s mother‘s care will be provided under TRICARE. 2.18.2.5.  If,   through   the   normal   course   of   MTF   inpatient   treatment,   medical 
complications arise that require advanced life support or specialized medical care (for the infant)  not  previously  authorized  on  the  original  SECDES  approval  letter,  or  if  said 
medical care is not reasonably available from local civilian healthcare providers, or if the required healthcare falls  outside of the capabilities of local civilian healthcare providers 
and, if the MTF does have the medical capability to treat the infant to save life, limb, or eyesight,  the  MTF  is  authorized  to  provide  treatment.    The  MTF  is  required  to 
immediately  contact  AFMOA/SGAT  and  submit  another  healthcare  request  to  the Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Administrative  Assistant  (SAF/AA).    MTF  direct  care  is 
expected  to  last  only  long  enough  to  stabilize  the  infant and  transfer  the  child  to  an accepting civilian medical facility.  TRICARE benefits may be extended to the infant if 
the sponsor adopts the child. 2.18.2.6.  Upon birth, register the infant child into Composite Healthcare System (CHCS) 
using  the  PAT CAT ―F29‖ and FMP ―60.‖   The use of this PATCAT and FMP will generate  a  bill  for  services.    The  bill  will  be  waived  if  Secretarial  Designee  status  has 
previously been granted. 2.19.  Abused Family Members/Dependents.  (Authority Title 10 U.S.C. § 1076; § 1408(h), §

abuse, the abused individual(s) or those affected by the knowledge of the abuse may receive DoD-sponsored  healthcare  (including  MTF  direct  care  and  TRICARE  network  benefits).  
Eligible  family  members  or  dependents  who  claim  associated  physical  or  psychological problems  may  apply  for  transitional  compensation  benefits  through  the installation  Military 
Personnel Section (MPS) and/or Accounting and Finance office.  When an individual meets 
----------------Page (30) Break----------------
  32  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
the criteria specified in this paragraph and requirements identified in DoDI 1342.24, AFI 36-3024,  and  AFI  36-3026V1_IP,  the  individual  may  be  issued  an  identification  card  for  the 
approved eligible transition period.  Benefits may include TRICARE or MTF direct medical care only, financial compensation, installation exchange, and commissary privileges as well 
as  other  benefits.    Special  circumstances  may  dictate  additional  transitional  compensation benefits  not  identified  in  this  instruction.    An  MTF  Commander  may  be  called  upon  to 
provide  a  medical  sufficiency  statement  if  required  from  the  installation  MPS  or  Finance section,  from  the  Air  Force  Personnel  or  Financial  Authority,  or  from  the  Defense  Finance 
and Accounting Service (DFAS).  Although eligible beneficiaries under this category may be entitled to transitional benefits approved by the appropriate Air Force Personnel or Financial 
Authority  in  coordination  with  the  DFAS,  approval  of  DoD  healthcare  may  first  require clinical  case  review  by  a  qualified  military  or  civilian  physician  employed  by  the  Federal 
Government.    Said  clinical  review  may  be required  to  establish  medical  sufficiency  and  to identify specific medical, dental, or psychological issues that may  exist as a direct  result of 
abuse received from the sponsor/Service Member. 2.19.2.  Eligible   dependent   family   members   of   a   Service   Member   who   received   a 
dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, was dismissed as a result of a court-martial, or was administratively separated from a Uniformed Service as a result of dependent abuse, may be 
entitled  to  medical  or  dental  care  for  problems  associated  with  the  documented  abuse.    A medical sufficiency statement from the nearest Air Force MTF Commander may be required. 
2.19.3.  If  a  medical  sufficiency  statement  is  required,  a  qualified  military  or  civilian physician  employed  by  the  Federal  Government  should  meet  with  each  affected  family 
member  to  assess  their  injuries  or  illnesses  (including  psychological  problems)  and  review available supporting clinical documents.  From the interview(s) and clinical case review, the 
provider should draft a brief medical narrative summary (for each identified family member) that identifies: 
2.19.3.1.  Each family member‘s symptoms and diagnosis.  Identify the injuries and/or illnesses (if any) affecting each of the abused family members. 
2.19.3.2.  Family history. 2.19.3.3.  Assessment  and  Analysis.    Include  a  brief  description  as  to  how  the  injury  or 
illness   has   affected   the   individual.      Include   physical   and   emotional   limitations, complications, and necessary rehabilitative requirements.  Include information regarding 
each family member‘s ability to cope with everyday challenges or their ability to perform routine life activities (working, attending school, social interaction, driving a car, etc.). 
2.19.3.4.  Prognosis. 2.19.4.  The  medical  narrative  summary  should  be  forwarded  to  the  TOPA  function.    The 
TOPA function is required to draft a separate standard medical sufficiency statement for the MTF  Commander  or  his/her  authorized  delegate‘s  signature.    The  medical sufficiency 
package   should   include   available   copies   of   any   applicable   medical   documents   or recommendations  and  analysis  from  civilian  providers.    A  separate  medical  narrative 
summary  (including  supporting  medical  documents  and  medical  sufficiency  statement)  will be created for each family member.  Identify each document with the patient‘s name, family 
----------------Page (31) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   33  
member   prefix,   sponsor   Social   Security   Number,   date   of   birth,   and   family   member relationship to the sponsor. 
2.19.5.  Submit the package(s) to the MTF Commander or his authorized delegate.  The MTF Commander may choose an authorized designee if he/she [commander] is not a physician or 
provider.    Often,  this  responsibility  is  delegated  to  the  Chief  of  the  Medical  Staff  (SGH).  The authorized designee is required to review the package for clinical adequacy and medical 
sufficiency.    The  delegate  is  then  required  to  select  one  of  the  sufficiency  statement recommendations below: 
2.19.5.1.  ―In my opinion there is adequate clinical evidence to indicate a  significant injury and/or illness (including psychological injury or illness) has occurred as a result of 
verifiable abuse at the hands of this family member‘s sponsor.  This patient will likely require  extensive  medical  treatment  and/or  rehabilitative care  for  the  next  ____  year(s) 
before his/her medical problem(s) may be resolved. 2.19.5.2.  ―In my opinion there is adequate clinical evidence to indicate a modest injury 
and/or  illness  (including  psychological  injury  or  illness)  has  occurred  as  a result  of verifiable abuse at the hands of this family member‘s sponsor.  This patient will likely 
require  a  reasonable amount  of  medical  treatment  and/or  rehabilitative  care  for the next ____ year(s) before his/her medical problems may be resolved.‖ 
2.19.5.3.  ―In  my  opinion,  I  find  no  obvious  medical  condition,  injury,  or  illness (including  psychological  injury  or  illness)  which  has  occurred  as  a  result  of  verifiable 
abuse at the hands of this family member‘s sponsor.  However, I cannot overlook the possibility  of  an  injury  or  illness  that  may  be  discovered  in  the  future  that  could  be 
directly related to the documented abuse this family member has received at the hands of his/her sponsor.‖ 
2.19.6.  The MTF shall provide the requesting agency (MPS, Finance office, or DFAS) with only the original medical sufficiency letter(s) and not the clinical narrative summary or any 
other medical-related documents. 2.19.7.  File  a  copy  of  the  medical  sufficiency  letter  along  with  the  clinical  narrative 
summary and all related medical documents in the patient‘s medical record. 2.19.8.  If the Air Force Personnel or Finance Authority, and/or the DFAS approve healthcare 
benefits,  the  eligibility  period  should  match  the  period  approved  for  the abused  family member‘s transitional compensation benefits. 
2.19.9.  If  all  or  some  transitional  benefits  are  denied,  the  discharged  or  separated  Service Member‘s family member dependents may apply for consideration of limited (MTF direct 
care  only)  medical  benefits  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF/AA).    If  approved, healthcare  is  specifically  limited  to  medical  services  necessary  to  treat  injuries  or  illnesses 
suffered as a direct result of the sponsor‘s abuse.  See the Secretarial Designee (SECDES) application section, identified in further detail in Chapter 4, for definitive SECDES program 
management instructions. 2.19.10.  If  requested,  by  one  or  more  family  members  of  the  discharged  Service  Member, 
the  MTF  is  required  to  submit  a  SECDES  application  to  the SAF/AA  (via  AFMOA/SGAT intermediary).    Confirmation  of  this  action  must  be  coordinated  with  the  abused  family 
----------------Page (32) Break----------------

member  dependent(s)  or  his/her  legal  guardian(s).    Upon  formal  notification  or  receipt  of approval of transitional compensation benefits (from the installation MPS or Finance Office), 
the   MTF   shall   submit   a   SECDES   application   to   the   SAF/AA   (via   AFMOA/SGAT intermediary) on behalf of the affected family member(s).  The MTF location responsible for 
assembling   the   SECDES   package should   include   the   standard   application   package documentation  identified  in  Chapter  4  and  Attachment  6,  to  include  the  application  letter 
signed by the MTF Commander and the medical summary or statement that clearly identifies the medical illness, injury or  condition (related to, or as a  consequence of abuse)  for which 
military healthcare is requested.

Review   Board   (DoDMERB)   provides   rules   for   determining   medical   acceptability   of applicants  for  appointment  to  a  U.S.  Military  Service  Academy,  Uniformed  Services 
University  of  Health  Sciences,  and  the  ROTC  scholarship  programs  of  the  U.S.  Armed Forces.    However,  not  withstanding  any  other  provision  of  the  DoDMERB  process,  an  Air 
Force MTF may provide limited examinations under the following circumstances: 2.30.4.1.  If a ROTC cadet‘s college, university, or institution does not have the ability to 
perform  a  physical  exam,  the  cadet  may  be  provided  an  examination(s)  at  an  MTF, including  admission  if  required  to  satisfy  clinical  diagnostic  requirements.    Uniformed 
Service   or   Service   Academy   applicants   may   receive   initial   service   eligibility examination(s) at an MTF.   For remedial ROTC  commissioning, Uniformed Service, or 
Service  Academy  entrance  examinations  that  require  additional  diagnostic  care  beyond an MTF‘s capabilities, refer the cadet or applicant to the closest MTF (with the required 
capabilities) for required medical testing. 2.30.5.  If  a  cadet  is  admitted,  contact  HQ  AFROTC/DOTF  at Maxwell  AFB,  AL  36112-
6106, DSN 493-6958. 2.30.6.  Cadets  who  are  admitted  for  any  reason  must  meet  a  board  of  medical  officers  for 
final  disposition.    The  board  is  composed  of  Medical  Corps  officers  familiar  with  the individual‘s case.  The board should consider the individual‘s diagnosis, required care, etc., 
and  other  factors  as  directed by  HQ  AFROTC.   Cadets  are  not  entitled  to  service  disability processing   under   AFI   36-3212,   Physical   Evaluation   for   Retention,   Retirement   and 
Separation, 2 Feb 2006, but the results of the medical board may be provided to the cadet so a  claim  can  be  filed  with  the  Department  of  Labor,  Federal  Employees  Compensation  Act 
(FECA), or the Veterans Affairs, as appropriate.  Provide a copy of the board results to HQ AFROTC; they will provide final disposition instructions for the patient. 
2.30.6.1.  Board proceedings must indicate the diagnosis, patient‘s line of duty status, physical  condition  upon  discharge,  a  statement  that  further  hospitalization  is  or  is  not 
required,  and  a  concise  medical  history.    If  the  individual  requires  additional  treatment beyond  the  hospitalization,  the  reason  and  probable  duration  of  the  treatment  must  be 
included. 2.30.6.2.  Two copies of the proceedings are prepared and attached to a completed SF 88, 
Report of Medical Examination, which indicates the date of discharge.  Send the report to HQ   AFROTC/DO   for   Air   Force   cadets.      For   Army   Cadets,   send   the   report   to 
Headquarters US  Army  ROTC,  Cadet  Command,  ATTN:    ATCC-PC,  Fort  Monroe  VA 23651-5237,  DSN  680-4534.    For  Navy  Cadets  send  the  report  to  Commander,  Naval 
Medical Command, Department of the Navy, Washington DC 20372-5120. 2.30.7.  Under  the  Federal  Employees  Compensation  Act  (FECA),  cadets  may  choose  their 
source of care if they meet FECA reimbursement criteria.  For example, the criteria include a provision  that  the  injury  or  illness  be  incurred  in  the  line  of  duty,  and  the  training  period 
meets certain criteria of the law.  Cadets cannot be forced to remain in an Air Force MTF if the  cadet  or  legal  guardian  chooses  another  source  of  care.    In  cases  where  the  cadet  or 
guardian chooses a non-DoD source of care, the cadet or guardian should sign: 2.30.7.1.  An ―against medical advice‖ or AMA discharge letter if a  serious  medical 
condition exists and the cadet is, in fact, leaving AMA.

2.30.7.2.  A  letter  explaining  the  Air  Force  (DoD)  is  not  responsible  for  any  financial obligation incurred as a  result of the choice.   If a cadet chooses to obtain care at a non-
DoD  site,  contact  HQ  AFROTC/DOT,  DSN  493-6958,  and  AFMSA/SG3SA,  1500 Wilson        Blvd,        Suite        120,        Arlington        VA        22209        via        e-mail; 
AFMSAHealth.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. 2.30.8.  Cadets requiring additional follow-up medical care  after hospitalization and/or after 
completing  summer  training,  military  exercise  training,  practical  military  training,  etc.,  are authorized  DoD  MTF  care  only.    Geographic  isolation  should  not  necessarily  excuse  any 
ROTC  cadet  or  membership  applicant  from  traveling  to  a  DoD  MTF  to  receive  follow-up care. 
2.30.9.  The Department of Labor (DOL), Workers‘ Compensation Fund, reimburses DoD for  medical  expenses  at  the  Inter-Agency  Rate  (IAR)  and/or  Inter-Agency  Outpatient  Rate 
(IAOPR) for individuals who incur an injury or illness traveling to or from, and participating in, practical military training, summer training sessions, practice cruises, flight training, or on 
a flight. 2.30.9.1.  A  member  of  the  Reserve  Officers‘  Training  Corps  is  entitled  to  receive 
disability benefits through the Dept of Labor when the individual suffers an injury in the line of duty during the period of the member‘s attendance at training.  Expenses incurred 
by   a   military   department   in   providing   hospitalization,   medical   and   surgical   care, necessary transportation  incident to that hospitalization or medical and surgical  care are 
also reimbursed by the Secretary of Labor from the Employees‘ Compensation Fund.  ―However, reimbursement  may  not  be  made  for  hospitalization  or  medical  or  surgical 
care   provided   an   individual   by   a   military   department   in   a   facility   of   a   military department.‖ (5 U.S.C. § 8140(f)).

States  and  are  hired  (excluding  contract  employees)  directly  or  indirectly  to  work  for  the DoD,  paid  from  appropriated  or  non-appropriated  funds,  including  Army  &  Air  Force 
Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  employees,  under  permanent  or  temporary  appointment.    This also  includes  certain  seamen  and  air  reserve  technicians  while  performing  duties  as  civil 
servants. 2.33.2.  Workers‘ Compensation Eligibility for Medical Services or Supplies.  Under the 
FECA Law, 5 U.S.C. Sub Section 8101, the United States shall furnish to an employee with a federal  job-related  illness  or  injury  the  services,  appliances,  and  supplies  prescribed  or 
recommended  by  a  qualified  physician,  to  cure,  give  relief,  reduce  the  disability,  or  aid  in lessening  the  amount  of  the  monthly  compensation.    Said  services,  appliances,  and/or 
supplies may be furnished by military MTFs, VA, or, U.S. Public Health facilities.  However, this instruction does not guarantee that the required service(s) or supplies will be available at 
any one particular military MTF, VA, or, U.S. Public Health facility.  When the local MTF has  the capacity  to  provide  this  care  and  supplies,  the employee  must  choose  to  either seek 
care through the MTF or the civilian sector.  Once the worker has chosen a care provider, he

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   45  
or  she  must  stay  with  that  provider  in  order  to  ensure coverage  by  OWCP  until  he  or  she either  obtains  permission  to  change  from  the  District  OWCP  office  or  is  referred  by  the 
designated  provider  to  a  new  provider.    The  employee  may  obtain  guidance  from  Civilian Personnel  Services  on  how  to  apply  for  coverage through  the  appropriate  compensation 
system.    A  Compensation  Act,  form  CA-16,  Authorization  for  Examination  C/S  and/or Treatment, authorizes an injured employee to obtain examination and/or treatment for up to 
60 days.  The Office of Workers‘ Compensation Program defines an ―injury‖ as a medical condition that evolves over a period of time less than a complete work shift (an ―illness‖ is 
defined as a medical condition evolving over more than a single work shift).  The CA-16 is used to authorize payment for medical care of injuries only and cannot be used for illnesses.  
The form is necessary for MTF care and prior to referring the patient outside of the MTF for a  consult  or  special  study.    If  the  patient  is  referred  out  to  a  specialist  for  assumption  of 
control of the case, the worker‘s supervisor completes the CA-16 to authorize payment to the specialist (again, only for the first 60 days following injury).    The form is prepared by the 
individual‘s supervisor and must be presented prior to treatment outside the MTF unless it is a  medical  emergency.    In  an  emergency,  the  supervisor  prepares  the  form  within  48  hours 
after  treatment  is  rendered.    If  a  CA-16 is created, a copy is filed in the individual‘s AF medical  record.    The  MTF  Patient  Administration  function  does  not  provide  advice  to 
employees or supervisors regarding form completion. 2.33.2.1.  Direct  MTF  medical  care  for  job  related  injuries  or  illnesses  requires:    a) 
Presentation of a completed CA-16.  A separate CA-16 is not required for each episode of follow-up care if a CA-16 was provided on the initial visit.  If follow-up care is required 
beyond 60 days of the initial issuance of the CA-16, the supervisor contacts the DOL for authorization to issue another CA-16; b) the care being provided is for the same illness or 
injury as on the initial visit; and c) the MTF has the capability to provide the care. 2.33.2.2.  Associated costs for supplies and services listed above should be addressed by 
Resource Management. 2.33.3.  Aeromedical evacuation is authorized IAW JTR Chapter 7, Part K, ―Medical Tvl‖ , 1 
March  12.    OCONUS  Aeromedical  evacuation  patients  who  have  been  validated  by  their respective  Patient  Movement  Requirements  Center  (PMRC)  as  not  requiring  direct  patient 
care  in  flight may travel as ―medical passengers‖ and as such will not be charged the ambulatory  reimbursement  rate  for  Aeromedical  evacuation  services  (as  identified  in  the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) DoD Reimbursable Rates, Tab I). 2.33.4.  Individuals  will  have  a  DD  Form  1173,  Uniformed  Services  Identification  and 
Privilege Card (Accountable) or appropriate TDY orders overseas. 2.33.5.  Wage Marine personnel and Civil Service Mariners are billed directly to the USPHS 
at  the  interagency  rate  by  the  MTF.    Do  not  collect  subsistence  for  inpatient  care  from  the individual.    Forward  a  SF  1080  along  with  the  DD  7/7A  to:    US  Public  Health  Service 
(USPHS) Division of Commissioned Personnel, Medical Affairs Branch, Room 4C-06, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville MD 20857. 
2.33.6.  Conditional Employment/Annual Occupational Exam Requirements.  According to 5 CFR,  Part  339.301,  Authority  to  Require  an  Examination,  an  agency  may  require  an 
individual  to  meet  the  physical  or  medical  requirements  of  his  or  her  position  (fitness  for duty) when the individual has applied for or occupies a position for which specific medical 
----------------Page (44) Break----------------
  46  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
standards  or  physical  requirements  exist,  or  where  federal  employees  are  subject  to  an established  medical  evaluation  program  that  requires  the  employee  to  report  for  a  medical 
examination whenever there is a direct question about the employee‘s continued capacity.  When  requested  in  writing  from  Civilian  Personnel  Services  (CPS),  the  MTF  provides 
occupational  exams  through  the  Occupational  Medicine  Services  Clinic  (if  present),  Flight Medicine Clinic or if neither of the other two clinics exists on the base or limited resources 
require its participation, Family Medicine Clinic. 2.33.6.1.  The  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  provides  medical  standards  for 
many  federal  civilian  jobs.    It  authorizes  agencies  (e.g.,  the  Air  Force)  to  develop  their own standards as well.  It is the responsibility of the worker‘s supervisor to accurately 
identify  functional  requirements and  environmental  factors  for a  job.    IAW  5  CFR  339, the Air Force must not charge workers for occupational examinations required by the Air 
Force. 2.33.6.2.  When the local MTF does not have the capability to provide an employer (AF) 
required  medical  examination  (or  a  portion  of  the  exam)  that  the  AF  is  responsible  for providing  free  of  charge  to  the  employee,  the  AF  may  arrange  to  have  the  examination 
(lab  tests,  etc.)  completed  in  the  civilian  sector  (non-DoD)  healthcare  community  after receiving authorization from the employee‘s unit commander. 
2.33.6.2.1.  The employee‘s unit commander must also authorize payment for the examination.      Payment   is   made   from   the   same   appropriation   that   funds   the 
employee‘s salary.  The Defense Health Program  (DHP)  appropriation  may  not  be used for the examinations, unless the employee‘s salary is DHP-funded (e.g., an MTF 
employee). 2.33.6.2.2.  The  Installation  Occupational  and  Environmental  Medicine  Consultant 
(IOEMC)  will  provide  clinical  oversight of  referrals/consults  to  ensure  they  are appropriate and justified. 
2.33.6.2.3.  The  MTF  provider‘s  support  staff  notifies  the  MTF  Resource Management  Office  (RMO)  that  a  private  sector  exam  is  needed  for  a  civil  service 
employee (the clinic must include the estimated cost of the exam/test). 2.33.6.2.4.  The  RMO  will  send  a  Request  for  Commander‘s  Authorization  of 
Payment for Civilian Medical Exam packet to the employee‘s Unit Commander.  The packet  contains  two  attachments:      (1)  Commander‘s Authorization of Payment for 
Civilian Medical Exam, and (2) Instructions for the Unit Resource Advisor. 2.33.6.2.5.  Commander‘s  Authorization  of  Payment  for  Civilian  Medical  Exam:  
This letter serves as the MTF‘s authorization to process the employee‘s referral.  It also expresses the Commander‘s acknowledgement that his/her unit funds will be 
used for payment of the exam. 2.33.6.2.6.  Instructions to Unit Resource Advisor:  This information sheet explains to 
the  employee‘s  Unit  Resource Advisor  the  steps  he/she  must  take  in  order  for payment  to  be  made  to  the  civilian  healthcare  provider.    Payment  will  not  be  made 
until exam results are received by the MTF. 
----------------Page (45) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   47  
2.33.6.2.7.  Once the RMO receives the Commander‘s Authorization of Payment for a Civilian Medical Exam from the employee‘s unit, a copy is provided to the MTF 
clinic.  The clinic will then schedule the employee‘s exam. 2.33.6.2.8.  The MTF clinic that schedules the employee‘s exam must emphasize to 
the civilian sector provider‘s office that results of the exam and the associated invoice for full and final payment must be sent to the MTF‘s Referral Management Center 
(RMC).   Note:  Be  sure  to  provide  the  address,  FAX,  point  of  contact  information. This is required in order to avert HIPAA and PHI violations as well as to ensure the 
provider receives payment. 2.33.6.2.9.  The  RMC  will  (1)  Forward  the  exam  results  to  the  MTF  provider  that 
requested the exam, and (2) Forward the invoice for the exam to RMO. 2.33.6.2.10.  The RMO will:  (1) Verify that the invoice contains ―Full‖ or ―Final‖ 
payment on the invoice.  If the invoice does not state that it is for full/final payment, then RMO must contact the civilian provider‘s billing office in order to receive a 
revised bill; (2) Process payment according to the option indicated by the employee‘s unit commander on the bottom of the Commander‘s Authorization of Payment for 
Civilian  Medical  Exam,  and  per  the  Instructions  to  the  Unit  Resource  Advisor.   Note:  RMO will  not  proceed  with  payment  until  exam  results  are  received  by  the 
MTF. 2.33.7.  State  Department  employees  who  must  be  aeromedically  evacuated  to  CONUS  are 
reported to the nearest Department of State principal or administrative officer who authorizes the move. 
2.33.8.  Except  as  noted in  above  paragraph  regarding  State  Department  employees,  federal civilian employees of the US Government who are covered under the State Department‘s 
medical  program  do  not  have  any  special  entitlement  based on  their  enrollment  in  that program.  The State Department‘s medical program is in effect an insurance program like 
Blue  Cross  and  Blue  Shield.    As  a  result,  healthcare  may  be  billed  to  this  program  if  the individual wishes.   If the claim is denied, the individual pays for his or her care.  Agencies 
involved in this program are: 2.33.8.1.  ACTION/Peace Corps staff. 
2.33.8.2.  Department of State:  Agency for International Development, US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, US Information Agency.

reimbursement for emergency dental care.  This is not a limitation on the entitlement, but on the  coverage.    Those  covered  under  the  State  Department  Medical  Program  must pay  the 
dental rate. 2.33.10.  Immunizations  may  be  provided  at  no  cost  to  civilian  federal  employees  living  in 
the CONUS who are preparing for a overseas assignment transfer, TDY or PCS, or who are CONUS-based  and  immunizations  are  required  by  the  destination  country  or  government 
component  to  meet  occupational  health  requirements.    For  individuals  participating  in  the State Department Medical Program, a request for immunizations will be provided on a DSL-

support  of  contingency  operations,  federal  civilian  employees  should  report  to  the MTF Force  Health  Management  (FHM)  or  Public  Health  Office  (PHO)  for  PDHA/PDHRA 
review.    After  clinical  review  by  the  Installation  Occupational  and  Environmental Medicine Consultant (IOEMC) or his or her alternate, if the employee‘s injury(s) or 
illness(s)  is  determined  to  be  deployment  connected  or  related,  the  FHM  or  PHO  will refer the employee to the MTF TOPA function.  The TOPA function verifies healthcare 
eligibility  based  on  the  IOEMC‘s  recommendation  and  facilitates  appointments  for eligible  employees.    Eligible  civilian  employees  will  receive  medical  care  at  the  same 
level and scope as that provided to active duty military service members. 2.33.11.4.1.  The worker is referred to CPS for guidance on completing an application 
for a compensation claim.  The worker is asked to declare in writing his or her choice to  receive  medical  care  either  within  the  MTF  or  from  a  civilian  source.    The  MTF 
works  with  CPS  to  facilitate  release  of  all  relevant  medical  information  to  the Installation Compensation Program  Administrator once the employee has  completed 
an application for workers‘ compensation (which authorizes that  release  of  relevant medical records).   Employees with acute medical needs may require immediate care 
within the MTF prior to applying for and obtaining compensation program coverage.  Care must be taken to avoid a gap in coverage between care provided by the MTF and 
the  determination  of  work  ―relatedness‖  by  OWCP  (or  the  applicable  insuring agency).      If   OWCP   determines   a   case   is   not   work   related,   the   Installation 
Occupational and Environmental Medical Consultant or his or her appointee/alternate reviews the  case  to  see  if  an  appeal  should  be  written  to  the  District  OWCP  (for 
appropriated employees).  If an appeal is appropriate, the reviewing provider writes it and coordinates with the ICPA to send it to the district OWCP office.  If no appeal is 
indicated or after an appeal, the decision of the OWCP district office is final.  If the final  OWCP  determination  is  that  the  case  is  not  work  related,  the  employee  is 
responsible for paying for his or her medical care and the MTF will cease to provide care.    The MTF  then  assists  the  employee  in  transferring  all  relevant  medical 
information  to  his  or  her  private  healthcare  provider  (once  the  employee  has  signed 
----------------Page (48) Break----------------
  50  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
an appropriate release).  When the healthcare needs of an employee‘s deployment related  injury  or  illness  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  local  MTF  and  the  case  is 
accepted by    OWCP  (or  the appropriate insurer)  the employee  should  be  assisted  in choosing and transferring to appropriate care that will accept compensation coverage. 
2.33.12.  Non-Deployment,  non-work  related  illness/injury  MTF  Healthcare:    Civil  Service or federal civilian employees may be provided limited MTF medical treatment of non-work 
related conditions on an outpatient basis at no charge to prevent excessive loss of time from duty, or when immediate occupational requirements dictate.  These cases should only be seen 
at the request of the employee‘s supervisor or work leader.  A physician must validate the need for care and must limit treatment to what is needed to complete the work shift.  Surgical 
procedures,  intravenous  fluids  and  prolonged  course  of  care  should  not  be  provided.  Controlled substances must not be administered.  Outpatient MTF medical care provided to 
Civil  Service  employees  for  the  urgent  relief  of  minor  illnesses  (e.g.,  sunburn,  insect bite/stings, etc.) during the duty period, must be  approved by  the MTF Commander.   If the 
MTF Commander authorizes treatment, the MTF outpatient care may only be administered to alleviate pain or when minor urgent treatment, during the duty period, from a private medical 
provider,  would  require  a  disproportionate  amount  of  time  lost  from  the  job.    If  simple outpatient medical care is approved by the MTF Commander and care is provided, the MTF 
and/or  the  Government  are  not  obligated  and do  not  assume  responsibility  for  continued treatment for any condition that could not be reasonably resolved during the initial episode of 
treatment.  The  MTF  Commander  has  authority  to  approve/authorize  care  when  medically necessary,  when  said  care  is  in the  best  interest  of  the  government,  and  only  if  MTF 
capabilities  exist.    The  Supplemental  Care  program  may  not  be  used  to  pay  for  referred civilian medical care and is not authorized under the provisions of this paragraph. 
2.33.12.1.  Federal  Civil  Service  employees  employed  outside  the  United  States  who require treatment for conditions not covered by the OWCP who are not beneficiaries of 
any  other  federal  agency  listed  in  this  chapter  and  dependents  of  such  employees  may receive space available care in Air Force MTFs outside the United States. Charges will be 
collected locally IAW DoD 6010.15-M, Military Treatment Facility Uniformed Business Office (UBO) Manual, from the individual at the interagency rate except that no charge 
will  be  made  for  immunizations  authorized  by  AR  40-562/AFJI  48-110/BUMEDINST 6230.15A/CG  COMDTINST  M6230.4F,  Immunizations  and  Chemoprophylaxis,  or  for 
occupational health services as authorized elsewhere in this chapter. 2.33.13.  Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employees, while generally not considered to be US 
Government employees for most benefits, are entitled to treatment as described below. 2.33.14.  Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employees‘ medical expenses are covered under a 
NAF self-insurance program.  This program covers NAF employees with on-the-job injuries and illnesses.  A Form LS-1, Request for Examination and/or CS Treatment, or a Form LS-
204,  Attending  Physician‘s  Supplementary  Report  (Longshore  and  Harbor  Workers‘ Compensation Act, as extended), is required before treating the patient in the same manner as 
a  CA-16,  Authorization  for  Examination  CS  and/or  Treatment,  is  required  for  appropriated fund employees.  Employees of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service use an  LA-202, 
Employer‘s First Report of Injury or Occupational Illness.

2.33.15.  Non-Appropriated  Fund  (NAF)  employees  may  be  given  pre-employment  and periodic  physicals  at  no  charge  to  the  individual  when  requested  in  writing  from  CPS  or 
deemed  necessary  for  medical  surveillance  by the  Occupational  Environmental  Health Working  Group.    The  MTF  must  also  have  the  capability  as  determined  by  the  MTF 
Commander. 2.33.16.  According  to  5  US  Code,  section  7901,  health  promotion  programs  may  be 
provided at no charge to civilian employees when space is available in the program.  Space availability is determined by the MTF Commander using guidance in Section 2G.  Medicine 
required for participation (e.g., nicotine patches) is furnished by the employee. 2.33.17.  Hearing aids are authorized for civilians stationed overseas on a reimbursable basis 
at US government cost when the hearing loss is not job related. 2.34.  Family Members (Dependents) of Civil Service Personnel.  Authority is 24 U.S.C. § 34.  
See further sponsor service affiliation for DEERS enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement in AFI 36-3026V1_IP. 
2.34.1.  Family  members  (dependents)  who  reside  overseas  and  where  their  civil  service sponsor  is  stationed  overseas  are  entitled  to  routine  healthcare  benefits  at  the  Inter-Agency 
Outpatient Rate (IAOPR) or Interagency Rate (IAR).  Family members of civilians stationed in the United States are  not entitled to any routine healthcare benefits.  For the purposes of 
this  paragraph,  civilian  personnel are  defined  as  US  Government  employees,  paid  from appropriated or non-appropriated funds, and who are US citizens. 
2.34.2.  Family  member  (dependents)  who  reside  overseas  and  where  their  civil  service sponsor is stationed overseas may be provided routine dental care on a space-available basis 
at the installation DTF and only if the DTF possesses the required capability to  address the family member‘s requested dental needs.  The DTF commander determines whether or not 
adequate capabilities exist.  When capabilities do not exist, care is limited to that required to relieve pain or undue suffering. 
2.34.3.  Aeromedical   evacuation   is   authorized   overseas   (intra-theater/region)   and   from overseas MTF locations to CONUS MTF destinations and back again to originating overseas 
location.  Other moves within CONUS for civilian family members are not authorized under this  instruction.  See  AFI  41-301,  Worldwide  Aeromedical  Evacuation  System  and  DoDI 
6000.11, Patient Movement for instruction on AE operations. 2.34.4.  Under  10  U.S.C.  §  1077,  the  following  types  of  care  are  not  provided,  or  provided 
with exceptions, to family members of Civil Service Personnel: 2.34.4.1.  Domiciliary or custodial care is not authorized. 
2.34.4.2.  Generally, prosthetic devices, hearing aids, orthopedic footwear, and spectacles are not authorized.  However, prosthetic devices, hearing aids, orthopedic footwear, and 
spectacles  for  dependents  of  US  Government  employees  located  outside  of  the  United States  and  at  stations  inside  the  United  States  where  adequate  civilian  facilities  are 
unavailable, may be sold to family members at cost from the United States. 2.34.4.3.  The elective correction of minor dermatological blemishes and marks or minor

Center (PMRC). 2.35.  Civilian Emergencies.  (Reference: Title 42 U.S.C. 1395dd., Examination and Treatment 
for Emergency Medical Conditions and Women in Labor (EMTALA), 1985.) 2.35.1.  Category  Definition.  Individuals  who  are  not  authorized  care  under  any  other 
provision of this instruction and require emergency medical or dental care. 2.35.2.  Medical and dental care is authorized to the extent necessary to save life or limb and 
prevent undue suffering.  Patients are transferred to a civilian medical facility as soon as they are  stabilized.    Collect  the  full-reimbursement rate from the individual or the individual‘s 
insurance company. 2.35.3.  Civilians treated in a natural disaster are not charged individually for outpatient care 
and charged only subsistence if they are provided inpatient care. 2.35.4.  Aeromedical evacuation of US citizens overseas is requested through the Department 
of State.  The United States embassy in the foreign country requests this assistance direct to the Department of State who in turn notifies the Patient Airlift Center.  Charges apply and the 
patient  is  responsible  for  payment.  When  charges  apply,  the  MTF  reporting  the  patient  for movement obtains a fund cite and billing address from the patient‘s sponsoring agency and 
provides that information when reporting the patient for movement.  If there is no sponsoring agency,  provide  a  billing  address  for  the  patient.    Prior  to  travel,  enter  patient/traveler 
pertinent information into TRAC2ES.  After travel is complete, obtain information necessary to support the billing process from TRAC2ES or contact GPMRC, HQ TRANSCOM, 505 D 
Street, Room 100, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5049, Commercial (618) 229-4200, DSN 779-4200, or (800) 303-9301, FAX DSN 779-4786 or the appropriate Patient Movement Requirements 
Center  (PMRC).    The  Patient  Airlift  Center  can  approximate  these  charges  when  requested by the Department of State.

a theater of operations, may receive cost-free post-deployment physical examinations and screening at an MTF. 
2.36.3.  Contractor  personnel  shall  deploy  with  a  minimum  180  day  supply  of  any  required medication, obtained at their own expense. 
2.36.4.  Elective care is not authorized, and in many instances, routine care is not authorized.  Always check the contract for specific terms. 
2.36.5.  Contractors not in a contingency or emergency situation may request approval from the   local   overseas   MTF   Commander   for   medical   care   beyond   emergency   treatment.  
Agreements  reached  under  this  paragraph  are  reported  as  a  special  narrative  section  in  the annual report outlined in Attachment 6. 
2.36.6.  A  patient  whose  disability  prevents  his  or  her  return  to  work  or  who  needs  a  long-term treatment for a chronic medical condition(s) is reported to the contractor for disposition.  
The patient may be returned to CONUS as soon as his/her condition permits via aeromedical evacuation at cost to the contractor.  If care in CONUS is required, the patient or contractor 
arranges for the care prior to transfer.  Care in CONUS MTFs is not authorized except while in transient status in the aeromedical evacuation system.

2.37.3.  Elective care is not authorized. 2.37.4.  Contractors  may  request  approval  from  the  overseas  MAJCOM  Commander  for 
medical care for their family members beyond emergency care.  Agreements reached under this  paragraph  are  reported  as  a  special  narrative  section  in  the  annual  report  outlined  in 
Attachment 6, for Secretarial Designees. 2.37.5.  Patients  with  medical  conditions  that  require  long  periods  of  care  or  extensive 
treatment,  as  determined  by  the  MTF  leadership,  will  be  transitioned  to  civilian  care  when possible.    A  patient,  for  which  a long-term  period  of  care  or  which  extensive  treatment  is 
expected, as determined by MTF leadership, may be transferred (via aeromedical evacuation) to  CONUS  as  soon  as  his/her  condition  permits.    If  healthcare  in  CONUS  is  required,  the 
patient or contractor arranges for the care prior to transfer.  Healthcare at CONUS MTFs is not  authorized  except  while  the  patient  is  in  transient  status  in  the  aeromedical  evacuation 
system. 2.37.6.  Aeromedical evacuation costs may be charged to the patient instead of the contractor 
depending on contract language, healthcare  related exceptions, and/or limitations (including aeromedical evacuation).  Military aeromedical evacuation should not be utilized if adequate 
commercial aircraft options are available.  Specific contract provisions may take precedence over this paragraph.

emergency   patients.      See   further   sponsor   service   affiliation   for   DEERS   enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement in AFI 36-3026V1_IP. 
2.38.1.1.  The DVA provides care for active duty and other DoD beneficiaries on a space-available basis, in accordance with Title 38 United States Code, Section 8111, Veterans 
Affairs and Department of Defense Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act, via resource sharing agreements. 
2.38.1.2.  Title  31  United  States Code,  Section  1535,  The  Economy  Act,  provides authority  for  federal  agencies  to  order  goods  and  services  from  other  federal  agencies 
(including other Military Departments and Defense Agencies) and to pay the actual costs of  those  goods  and  services.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  DoD  Financial 
Management  Regulation  Volume  11A  Chapter  3,  the  MTF  Commander  may  provide such  services  under  the  limitations  of  this  paragraph.    Unless  this  instruction  specifies 
otherwise, this paragraph applies when non-DoD Federal agencies request healthcare for their  beneficiaries  in  an  Air  Force  MTF.  The  appropriate  agency  official  must  request 
MTF services in writing.  This authority also applies to occupational health services.  The MTF  shall  provide  a  copy  of  occupational  health  exams  results  and  other  medical 
services when requested upon receipt of patient authorization. 2.38.2.  Dependent  Parents  and  Parents-In-Law.    When  MTF  direct  care  eligibility  is 
approved  by  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service  (DFAS),  authorized  dependent parents  and  parents-in-law  may  be  treated  in  an  MTF  on  a  space  available  basis.    Family 
members  in  this  category  are  not  eligible  for  TRICARE  and  cannot  be  referred  for  civilian care  at  Government  expense.    Prior  to  providing  space-available  treatment,  ensure  the 
sponsor and patient understand that when MTF personnel cannot provide the necessary care, on  a  space-available  basis,  or  if  the  required  healthcare  can  no  longer  be  provided  due  to 
limited MTF capacity or capability, the parent(s) or parent-in-law(s) will likely be discharged to  a  civilian  medical  facility.    Continued  healthcare  costs  at  civilian  medical  facilities  are 
paid  by  the  parent(s) or  parent(s)-in-law.    MTF  personnel  may  authorize  supplemental  care funds for diagnostic tests and ancillary services for parents and parents-in-law, only when the 
patient remains in an inpatient status.  Both the patient and sponsor will be informed of their financial responsibility when discharged/transferred to civilian care. 
2.38.3.  Expanded Medical Care for Caregivers of Members of the Armed Forces Recovering from  Serious  Injuries  or  Illnesses.    This  paragraph  includes  Identification,  Tracking,  and 
Reporting Requirements. 2.38.3.1.  In  appreciation  of  the  selfless  service  that  caregivers  provide  to  seriously 
injured  or  ill  Service  Members,  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  2008, Section  1672  and  authority  contained  in  Title  10,  United  States  Code,  Section  1074, 
authorizes  individuals  designated  as  caregivers  by  Service  Members,  to  receive  space available inpatient and outpatient medical care at any MTF.  To qualify, seriously ill/very 
seriously  ill  caregivers  must  meet  the  specific  requirements.    MTF  Commanders  must ensure  their  providers  and  medical  support personnel  are  aware  of  the  requirements  of 
this expanded benefit. 2.38.3.2.  MTFs  are  required  to  inform  all  Service  Members  who  are  identified  as 
seriously  injured  or seriously  ill  of  this  benefit.    This  also  includes  Service  Members at local civilian or Veterans Affairs (VA) medical institutions. 
----------------Page (54) Break----------------
  56  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
2.38.3.3.  For the designated caregiver to qualify, the Service Member‘s injury or illness must be incurred In the Line of Duty while on Active Duty in the Armed Forces and be of 
such  severity  that  the  Service  Member  may  be  rendered  medically  unfit  to  perform  the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, rating as contained in the National Defense Act for 
Fiscal year 2008, section 1602. 2.38.3.4.  The designated caregiver must be: 
2.38.3.4.1.  On invitational travel orders while caring for the Service Member. 2.38.3.4.2.  A non-medical attendant caring for the Service Member. 
2.38.3.4.3.  Receiving  per  diem  payments  from  DoD  while  caring  for  the  Service Member. 
2.38.3.5.  When the qualifications above are fulfilled, space-available inpatient/outpatient medical care is authorized for the qualified caregiver at any MTF.  Title 10, United States 
Code, Section 1076 specifies that the commanding officer or the officer-in-charge at the designated  MTF  will  determine  what  care  is  available  based  on  space,  facilities,  and 
capabilities.    Care  authorized  by  this  instruction  may  not  be  permitted  to  interfere  with the  primary  mission  of  the  MTF.    Authorization  for  care  terminates  for  the  caregiver 
when the qualifications specified above cease to be met. 2.38.3.6.  Each  MTF  Resource  Management  Office  will  seek  reimbursement  for  MTF 
healthcare  provided  to  caregivers  who  possess  third-party  payer  insurance  in  the  same manner as costs are collected for the provision of care for trauma care and other medical 
care  provided  to  civilians.  The  MTF  TRICARE  Operations  and  Patient  Administration function will serve as the central data collection, tracking, and reporting office.  All Air 
Force MTFs are responsible for identifying, tracking and reporting each of their seriously injured or ill Service Members, their caregivers, and associated caregiver healthcare costs 
according to the instructions identified below. 2.38.3.7.  Current   Limiting   Factors.      CHCS   provides   basic   SI/VSI   identification 
capabilities.    This  function  is  generally  only  activated  in  conjunction  with  an  inpatient admission.  When tracking SI/VSI Service Members admitted to civilian or VA medical 
facilities, non-bedded   MTFs,   who   do   not   employ   qualified   inpatient   coding   or supplemental   inpatient   coding   compliance   software,   may   experience   un-intended 
automated inpatient  records management,  coding,  and  SIDR  errors  if  this  mechanism  is activated. 
2.38.3.8.  Interim  Solution  (Overview).    To  offset  this  limited  functionality  and  to streamline the data collection and analysis process, the TRICARE Operations and Patient 
Administration  function  has  been  identified  as  the  central  data  collection,  tracking,  and reporting office to minimize confusion and focus overall program efforts; however their 
mission cannot be met without the support from several internal and external customers. 2.38.3.9.  MTF Responsibilities (Identification, Tracking, and Information Management). 
2.38.3.9.1.  Each   MTF   TOPA   function   will   establish   rapport   with   multiple information  offices/sources  to  collect  this  information.    These  potential  sources 
include, but are not limited to: 2.38.3.9.1.1.  Internal  Customers/Sources:  MTF  providers,  case  managers,  the

Section 2G—Eligibility Priority and Verification Procedures 
2.39.  Eligibility  Priority  and  Limiting  Services  in  the  Direct  Care  System.  MTFs  provide care without regard to the sponsor‘s Service affiliation, rank or grade, according to 10 U.S.C. § 
1071-1110b.    Enrollment  to  TRICARE  Prime  is  mandatory  for  all  ADSMs.    Refer  to  Health Affairs (HA) Policy 11-005, TRICARE Policy for Access to Care for priority of access to MTF 
care by beneficiary status. 2.39.1.  When individuals fall into several beneficiary categories provide care at their highest 
priority level. If unable to determine a beneficiary‘s eligibility for healthcare, contact the AFMOA Health Benefits office for assistance. 
2.40.  Eligibility Verification.  MTFs do not establish healthcare eligibility.  Each Uniformed Service    personnel    authority    establishes    healthcare    eligibility    through    a    credentialing 
----------------Page (58) Break----------------
  60  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
confirmation  process  that  ensures  authorized  beneficiaries  are  identified  in  DEERS.    MTFs  are responsible  for  verifying healthcare  eligibility  for  each  beneficiary  seeking  healthcare  in  the 
Military  Health  System  (MHS)  by  referencing  DEERS.    The  installation  MPS  or  Element  is generally  responsible  for  validating  a  beneficiary‘s  eligibility  for  DoD  benefits  (including 
healthcare).    For  additional  information  regarding  the  requirements  to  establish  healthcare eligibility refer to AFI 36-3026V1_IP.  Designated MTF personnel confirm the patient‘s identity 
and  verify  entitlement  by  performing  a  DEERS  and  identification  (ID)  card ―check.‖  DEERS eligibility  may  be  verified  by  accessing  the  Composite  Health  Care  System  (CHCS)-DEERS 
eligibility  menu option  or  by  referring  to  the General  Inquiry  of  DEERS  Internet  website  (user ID  and  password  is  required).    MTF  personnel  must  contact their  information  site  security 
manager  to  obtain  access  to  this  website.    Eligibility  questions  should  be  directed  to  the TRICARE  Operations  and  Patient  Administration  Flight  Commander  or  other  MTF  authorized 
official(s). 2.40.1.  Individuals  requesting  care  must  provide  satisfactory  evidence  of  their  beneficiary 
status (e.g., a valid ID card and a DEERS eligibility check). Children under age 10 must be enrolled  in  DEERS,  but  generally  do  not  require  their  own  ID  card  to  prove  healthcare 
eligibility.  The exception to this rule is for children who are eligible beneficiaries, but whose guardians  are  not  MHS  beneficiaries.    MTF  personnel  should  not  provide  routine  care  to 
patients  with  questionable  eligibility  until  they  make  a  final  determination  on a patient‘s eligibility.  Eligible  beneficiaries  enrolled  in  a  Uniformed  Services  Family  Health  Plan 
(USFHP)  are  not  eligible  for  routine  care  at  MTFs.  In  an  emergency,  always  provide  care first, and determine eligibility after treatment. 
2.40.2.  Eligibility verification is a two-step process. First, the patient must present a valid ID card.  Designated MTF personnel shall ensure all patients seeking direct MTF care, including 
Service Members in uniform, present a valid ID before MTF healthcare is provided.  RCSMs and  their  family  members  who  have  presented  a  valid  ID  card  and  passed  a  DEERS  check 
will not be asked for a copy of active duty orders. 2.40.3.  The  second  step  in  verifying  a  person‘s  eligibility  status  can  be  performing  a 
―DEERS check.‖  MTFs will perform DEERS checks on all beneficiaries presenting for care. 2.40.3.1.  Not  all  beneficiaries  are  enrolled  in  DEERS.    When  the  DEERS  verification 
process fails to confirm  eligibility,  a competent  medical officer is  required to perform  a brief  assessment  to  identify  whether  the  patient  would  be  at  risk  without  the  requested 
treatment  or  care.    If  there  is  a  possibility  of  risk  to  either  the  patient  or  the  Air  Force, treat  the patient.    Patients  who cannot  establish  their  eligibility  for  healthcare  must  first 
sign  a  locally  created  statement  (or  standardized  AFMS  statement  if  available)  that indicates  their  willingness  to  provide  documentation  of  eligibility  within  30  days  or  be 
held responsible for the costs associated with the requested treatment or care.  After the 30th  day,  if  the  individual  has  not  produced  evidence  that  establishes  eligibility,  the 
TRICARE   Operations   and   Patient   Administration   Flight   shall   forward   the   patient information  to  Resource  Management  Flight  to  initiate  the  billing  process.    This 
procedure applies to outpatient direct care, inpatient care, and ancillary care. 2.40.3.2.  If the patient fails a DEERS eligibility check, provide routine care in the direct 
care system to these categories of patients when/for: 
----------------Page (59) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   61  
2.40.3.2.1.  The patient is a member of the Reserve Component on active or inactive duty  for less than 30 days and presents with a copy of their orders or administrative 
documentation. 2.40.3.2.2.  The patient is a member of the Reserve Component on active or inactive 
duty status, and is seeking healthcare related to an ―In Line of Duty‖ medical/dental condition or a condition which is currently under line of duty investigation IAW AFI 
36-2910,  Line of Duty  (Misconduct) Determination.  Medical care may be provided to an RCSM of another US Military Service, provided the Service Member produces 
an appropriate service ―In Line of Duty‖ determination approval document signed by the member‘s command authority. 
2.40.3.3.  RCSMs on active duty  for greater than 30 days and their family members must present a valid ID card and pass a DEERS check per para 2.40.1.1 above.  If, and only if, 
the DEERS check does not pass, the RCSM or the family member must present a copy of the member‘s active duty orders.  If the RCSM is issued ―delayed-effective-date‖ active 
duty orders for more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation, the member and the member‘s family are eligible for ―early‖ TRICARE medical and dental benefits 
beginning on the later of either: (a) the date their orders were issued or (b) 90 days before the Service Member reports for duty or is ―activated‖ to active duty.  Refer to Attachment 
25  and  Attachment  26,  Reserve  Healthcare  Eligibility  Matrix,  Contingency  Operations for additional eligibility information for RCSMs and their families. 
2.40.3.4.  TRICARE  Prime/TRICARE  Prime  Remote  coverage  is  automatic  following birth or adoption and for 60 days thereafter or 90 days for OCONUS.  The family must; 
however, submit a completed TRICARE Prime enrollment application in enough time for the application to be processed by the 60th day of life/custody.  After 60 days, additional 
claims  will  be  processed  as  TRICARE  Standard  (higher  costs)  until  365  days  after  the child's birth or adoption.  On day 366, DEERS will indicate "loss of eligibility," and the 
child  will  no  longer  be  eligible  to  receive  any  TRICARE  benefits.    MTF  personnel  are encouraged to remind new parents to visit the local DEERS office to update their family 
member DEERS status as soon as possible. 2.40.3.5.  The  patient  is  a  Secretarial  Designee  (Use  the  designee  letter  to  verify 
eligibility  and  benefits).    Ensure  the  patient  only  receives  care  limited  to  the  specific dates and diagnosis annotated in the approval letter. 
2.40.3.6.  The  patient  is  a  foreign  military  sponsor  or  family  member.   Note:  Foreign military active and reserve members (and their family member dependents) are generally 
issued  ID cards and  entered  into  DEERS  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-3026V1_IP.    If no ID card is provided, ask for a copy of the Foreign Service Member‘s orders.  Refer to 
Section  2D,  Healthcare  for  Foreign  Forces  Members,  for  further  direction  on  potential billing issues. 
2.40.3.7.  The  sponsor  is  stationed  overseas,  afloat,  or  has  an  Army  or  Air  Force  Post Office  (APO)  or  Fleet  Post  Office  (FPO)  address.  The  patient  should  present  some 
documentation to indicate the sponsor‘s status, e.g., TDY or PCS orders. 2.40.4.  Reserve Component Eligibility Verification.  The failure of a DEERS check will not 
be  the  sole  basis  for  denying  healthcare  to  RCSMs.    There  may  be  circumstances  when  a 
----------------Page (60) Break----------------
  62  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
RCSM   may   be   eligible   for   healthcare   (including   pharmacy   benefits)   and   a   DEERS verification check fails.  In this situation, the member should present one of the following: 
2.40.4.1.  A completed and approved ―In Line of Duty‖ AF Form 348 or AFRC 348 (for Air Force Reserve Service Members). 
2.40.4.2.  An AF Form 348 (with the first side completed and signed by a provider). 2.40.4.3.  A copy of their active duty orders. 
2.40.5.  If  the  documents  referenced  above  are  not  produced,  do  not  simply  deny  medical care.  If the RCSM seeking healthcare claims the injury or illness is service-connected or first 
presented  while  he  or  she  was  on  Active  Duty  or  in  IDT  status,  the  injury  or  illness  is presumed  to  have  occurred  in  the  line  of  duty.    The  MTF  TOPA  function  is,  however, 
responsible for contacting the RCSM‘s unit to verify the LOD process has been initiated. 2.40.6.  Reserve  Component  Service  Members  residing  in  TPR  areas  with  prescriptions  to 
treat symptoms resulting from service-connected ―In-Line-of Duty‖ injuries or illnesses, may obtain  civilian  prescriptions  from  participating network  pharmacies.    Reserve  Component 
Service  Members  are  required  to  purchase  or  pay  for  the  prescription(s),  then  file  a reimbursement request through Express Scripts following guidance on the MMSO web site at 
http://www.tricare.mil/tma/MMSO/. 2.40.7.  Appellate    Leave    Eligibility/Enrollment    for    Active    Duty    Service    Members:  
Enrollment to TRICARE Prime is mandatory for all ADSMs.  This requirement does not end when the ADSM enters appellate leave status.  ADSMs on appellate leave are not eligible for 
TRICARE  Prime  Remote  (TPR)  because  they  lack  a  permanent  assignment  to  a  TPR location.  ADSMs in  appellate leave status shall remain  enrolled in TRICARE Prime, at an 
MTF, until their separation, discharge, or retirement date.  Note: See further sponsor service affiliation for DEERS enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement in AFI 36-3026V1_IP.  
ADSMs  in  appellate  leave  status  may  transfer  their  enrollment  to  another  MTF.  Upon notification  or  discovery  of  an  ADSM  in  appellate  leave  status,  the  local  MTF  TOPA 
function  shall  brief  the  ADSM  about  how  he  or  she  may  access  MHS  healthcare  while  in appellate leave status.  Except in an emergency, at no time is a Service Member in appellate 
leave status authorized to seek care outside an MTF without prior approval. 2.41.  Dependency  Determinations  for  Incapacitated  Children.  AFI  36-3026V1_IP  outlines 
the  initial  eligibility  criteria  and  procedures  to  apply  for  continued  benefits  for  a  child  who becomes incapacitated before losing eligibility at age 21, or 23 if enrolled as a full-time student. 
Children enrolled in TRICARE Young Adult do not fall under the provisions of this paragraph. 2.41.1.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service-Indianapolis Center (DFAS-IN) is the 
final  approving  authority  for  dependency  determinations.    The  Manpower,  Personnel,  and Services  (MPSs)  and  Base  Finance  Office  review  DD  137-5  and  other  documentation  to 
determine  if  the  initial  eligibility  criteria  warrant  further  processing  and  forwarding  to  the Defense Finance and Accounting Service-Indianapolis Center (DFAS-IN). 
2.41.2.  A  medical  statement  in  narrative  format  from  the  attending  physician,  or  primary care manager, including a medical sufficiency statement (MSS) (endorsement for or against 
dependency  status)  must  be  included  in  the  dependency  determination  application  package 
----------------Page (61) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   63  
from the MTF.  The MTF Commander is responsible for completing the MSS. However, the Commander may delegate the responsibility. 
2.41.3.  The  patient  and/or  their  sponsor  is  responsible  for  obtaining  and  providing  any supporting  medical  documentation  required  for  the  application  package.    The  TOPA  Office 
will  coordinate  all  requests  for  dependency  determinations  with  the  Chief  of  Medical  Staff (SGH),  or  equivalent  senior  MTF  physician  if  no  SGH  position  exists.    Final  medical 
dependency review rests with the MTF Commander or his designee.  If the MTF Commander has delegated endorsement authority to the MTF/SGH, the application package does not need 
the  MTF  Commander‘s  signature  before  forwarding  to  officials  at  the  installation personnel/finance  office.    The  completed  application  package  is  provided  to  the  sponsor 
regardless of medical sufficiency endorsement (approval) or non-endorsement (disapproval). 2.41.4.  If the patient‘s care is rendered outside of the MTF and it would be a burden on the 
patient  or  sponsor  to  travel  to  the  MTF  solely  to  process  the  MSS,  the  MSS  may  be completed by a civilian provider. The civilian provider will complete the recommendation in 
paragraph two of the form (Attachment 4), sign, and submit the MSS directly to DFAS.  In these  cases,  a  medical  statement  as  required  in  2.41.2  is  not  required  if  the  provider 
completing  the  MSS  maintains  medical  records  that  support  the  MSS  determination  in 2.41.6. In order to establish medical incapacity, the patient‘s illness must be substantial and 
truly disabling.  In addition, the medical incapacity must occur before the individual‘s 21st birthday (or  23rd  birthday  if  enrolled  as  a  full-time  student  when  incapacitation  occurred).  
The Air Force does not consider a diagnosis of alcoholism/or drug abuse as an incapacitating illness  for  the  purposes  of  dependency  determinations.  The  likelihood  of  future  medical 
expenditures and/or the existence of a medical  condition that will worsen over time, do not justify a determination of medical incapacity if no incapacitation currently exists. 
2.41.5.  The civilian or MTF provider will include the following information in the medical statement: 
2.41.5.1.  Diagnosis (use medical and layperson‘s terms). 2.41.5.2.  Summary of the individual‘s incapacitation, including the nature and extent of 
the illness or disease.  Non-medical personnel must be able to understand this summary. 2.41.5.3.  Explain how the incapacity affects the individual‘s ability to perform routine 
life activities, such as self-care. 2.41.5.4.  Age  when  the  incapacitation  began  (might  not  be  the  same  as  when medical 
personnel diagnosed the illness or disease). 2.41.5.5.  Probable duration of the incapacitation.  Indicate if the incapacity predated the 
individual‘s (21st) or (23rd) birthday and has been continuous since diagnosis. 2.41.5.6.  Based  on  the  healthcare  provider‘s  professional  opinion,  indicate  if  the 
incapacity makes the individual incapable of self-support. 2.41.6.  Depending on the circumstances involved in the dependency determination, the MTF 
Commander or civilian provider recommends one of the following endorsements (approved, disapproved, or no determination made) in the MSS (see Attachment 4): 
2.41.6.1.  Approved:    If  incapacity  existed  before  age  (21)  or  (23  years  for  dependent children attending college or university as a full-time student) and continues to exist, then 
----------------Page (62) Break----------------
  64  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
indicate: ―Medical sufficiency is established based on the patient‘s medical condition.  This  individual  is  incapable  of  self-support  because  of  a  mental  or  physical  incapacity 
that has existed on a continuous basis and originated before the individual‘s [choose one of the following ages based on the child‘s school status]: (21st) or (23rd) birthday and 
may be resolved within (estimate of years) years.‖  If incapacity will not be resolved, then conclude prior sentence with, ―...and will not be resolved in the foreseeable future.‖ 
2.41.6.2.  Disapproved:  If there is no incapacitating illness or/disease then indicate, ―The patient‘s condition is such that it does not establish medical sufficiency.‖ 
2.41.6.3.  Disapproved:  If an incapacitation did not exist before age (21) or (23 years for dependent children attending college or university as a full-time student) and continues to 
exist, then indicate, ―This individual is incapable of self-support because  of a mental or physical incapacity that exists at this time.  It is my opinion (based upon SGH review if 
the MTF COMMANDER is not a physician) that this incapacity did not exist before the individual‘s [choose one of the following ages based on the child‘s school status] (21st) 
or (23rd) birthday.‖ 2.41.6.4.  No Determination Made:  Medical sufficiency of patient‘s medical condition or 
supporting  documentation  is  lacking;  therefore,  no  determination  of  incapacity  can  be made at this time. 
2.41.7.  The MTF or civilian provider completing the MSS shall provide the sponsor with the completed request package.  However, only an approved MSS must be submitted to DFAS. 
The sponsor is responsible for coordinating with the appropriate finance and MPS officials.  However, if circumstances exist where the sponsor is unable to transfer the request package 
to the appropriate finance and/or MPS officials, and procedures listed in para 2.41.4. are not possible, send the completed package to the following: 
2.41.7.1.  Installation  finance  office  if  the  Commander‘s  endorsement  supports  the request. 
2.41.7.2.  To the MPS if the Commander‘s endorsement does not support the request. 2.41.8.  A  copy  of  the  medical  sufficiency  statement  and  any  other  supporting  medical

patient‘s civilian provider if there is new or compelling information.  The MTF Commander or patient‘s civilian provider can review and, if the commander determines a change from 
original  recommendation  to  the  Military  Finance  Office  is  warranted,  will  so  notify  that office.    DFAS-IN  remains  the  ultimate  decision  authority  for  granting  dependency  status

2.42.  TRICARE   Extended   Care   Health   Option   (ECHO).  The   TRICARE   ECHO   is   a supplement to the TRICARE Basic Program.  The purpose of the TRICARE ECHO is to provide 
an additional financial resource for an integrated set of services and supplies designed to assist in the  reduction  of  the  disabling  effects of the beneficiary‘s qualifying condition.  It does not 
provide  acute  care  or  benefits  through  the  TRICARE  Basic  Program.    Services  include  those 
----------------Page (63) Break----------------

be authorized under the TRICARE ECHO program-those services must be authorized under the TRICARE program option the beneficiary is using (TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, 
TRICARE  Standard,  TRICARE  Extra).    If  a  beneficiary's  family  member  has  a condition  that may  qualify  for  services  under TRICARE  ECHO, they  should  contact  their  regional  contractor 
for assistance.   This instruction provides only the fundamental aspects of the program.  For more definitive  information  regarding  the  TRICARE  ECHO  refer  to  the  TRICARE  Benefits  Internet

2.42.5.1.  Diagnostic  procedures  to  establish  a  qualifying  condition  or  to  measure  the extent  of  functional loss  resulting  from  a  qualifying  condition.    Diagnostic  services

individual  professional  provider  on  an  inpatient  or  outpatient  basis  and  rendered  in  the beneficiary‘s natural environment.  This includes at home, at school, or other location 
that is suitable for the type of services being rendered. 2.42.5.3.  Training that teaches the use of assistive technology devices or to acquire skills

TRICARE ECHO requirements. 2.42.5.4.  Special  education  as  provided  by the  Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education 
Act and defined at 34 CFR 300.26 and that is specifically designed to accommodate the disabling  effects  of  the  qualifying  condition.    Other public  programs  and  facilities  must 
be  used  to  the  extent  available  and adequate.    The  local  educational  agency  with responsibility  for  the  beneficiary  is  the  sole  agency  to  provide  public  facility  use 
certification for special education services. 2.42.5.5.  Institutional  care  within  a  state,  as  defined  in  32  CFR  199.2,  in  private

2.42.6.17.  Therapeutic absences. Therapeutic absences from an inpatient facility or from home for a homebound beneficiary are excluded. 
2.42.6.18.  Custodial care. Custodial care, as defined in 32 CFR 199.2 is not a stand-alone benefit.    Services   generally  rendered  as  custodial  care  may  be  provided  only  as 
specifically identified in this section. 2.42.6.19.  Domiciliary care. Domiciliary care, as defined in 32 CFR 199.2, is excluded. 
2.42.6.20.  Respite  care.  Respite  care  for  the  purpose  of  covering  primary  caregiver  (as defined  in  32  CFR  199.2)  absences  due  to   deployment,  employment,  seeking  of 
employment or to pursue education is excluded. Authorized respite care covers only the TRICARE ECHO beneficiary, not siblings or others who may reside in or be visiting in 
the beneficiary‘s residence. 2.43.  TRICARE ECHO Home Healthcare (EHHC).  The EHHC benefit provides coverage of 
home healthcare services and respite care services specified in this section. 2.43.1.  Home healthcare.  Covered TRICARE ECHO home healthcare services are the same 
as, and provided under the same conditions as, services described in 32 CFR 199.4(e)(21)(i), except that they are not limited to part-time or intermittent services. Custodial care services, 
as  defined  in  32  CFR  199.2,  may  be  provided  to  the  extent  such  services  are  provided  in conjunction  with  authorized  TRICARE  ECHO  home  healthcare  services,  including  the 
EHHC respite care benefit specified in this section. Beneficiaries who are authorized EHHC will receive all home healthcare services under EHHC and no portion will be provided under 
the TRICARE Basic Program.  TRICARE-authorized home health agencies are not required to use the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) to assess beneficiaries who are 
authorized EHHC. 2.43.2.  Respite care. EHHC beneficiaries whose plan of care includes frequent interventions 
by  the  primary caregiver(s)  are  eligible  for  respite  care  services  in  lieu  of  the  TRICARE ECHO general respite care benefit. For the purpose of this section, the term ―frequent‖ means 
―more than two interventions during the eight-hour period per day that the primary caregiver would normally be sleeping.‖ The services performed by the primary caregiver are those that 
can  be  performed  safely  and  effectively  by  the  average  non-medical  person  without  direct supervision  of  a  healthcare  provider  after  the  primary  caregiver  has been  trained  by 
appropriate  medical  personnel.  EHHC  beneficiaries  in  this  situation  are  eligible  for  a maximum of eight hours per day, 5 days per week, of respite care by a TRICARE-authorized 
home  health  agency.  The  home  health  agency  will  provide  the  healthcare  interventions  or services  for  the  covered  beneficiary  so  that  the  primary  caregiver  is  relieved  of  the 
responsibility  to  provide  such  interventions  or  services  for  the  duration  of  that  period  of respite care.  The home health agency will not provide baby-sitting or childcare services for 
other  members  of  the  family.  The  benefit  is  not  cumulative.  That  is,  any  respite  care  hours not  used  in  a  given  day  may  not  be  carried  over  or  banked  for  use  on  another  occasion.  
Additionally, the eight-hour respite care periods will not be provided consecutively, that is, a respite  care  period  on  one  calendar  day  will  not  be  immediately  followed  by  a  respite  care 
----------------Page (69) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   71  
period the next calendar day. The Government‘s cost-share incurred for these services accrue to the maximum yearly TRICARE ECHO Home Healthcare benefit. 
2.43.3.  EHHC eligibility. The EHHC is authorized for beneficiaries who meet all applicable TRICARE ECHO eligibility requirements and who: 
2.43.3.1.  Physically reside within the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or Guam; and, 
2.43.3.2.  Are homebound, as defined in 32 CFR 199.2; and, 2.43.3.3.  Require medically necessary skilled services that exceed the level of coverage 
provided under the Basic Program‘s home healthcare benefit; and/or, 2.43.3.4.  Require  frequent  interventions  by  the  primary  caregiver(s)  such  that  respite 
care services are necessary to allow primary caregiver(s) the opportunity to rest; and, 2.43.3.5.  Are case managed to include a reassessment at least every 90 days, and receive 
services as outlined in a written plan of care; and, 2.43.3.6.  Receive all home healthcare services from a TRICARE-authorized home health 
agency, as described in 32 CFR 199.6(b)(4)(xv), in the beneficiary‘s primary residence. 2.43.3.7.  To  avoid  delaying  receipt  of  EHHC  services  while  completing  the  TRICARE 
ECHO  registration  process,  in  particular  awaiting  completion  of  enrollment  in  the Exceptional  Family  Member  Program  (EFMP)  of  the  sponsor‘s  service,  otherwise 
TRICARE  ECHO -eligible  beneficiaries  may  be  granted  provisional  eligibility  for  a period of not more than 90 days. Upon completion of the TRICARE ECHO registration 
process,  the  provisional  status  will  be  converted  to  permanent  and  subject  to  all  other applicable  requirements  and  made  retroactive  to  the  date  of  the  request  for  EHHC  or 
respite  care  services.    If  it  is  determined  that  the  beneficiary  is  not  eligible  for  the TRICARE   ECHO,   the   provisional   status   will   be   terminated;   authorization   and 
government  liability  for TRICARE  ECHO benefits  will  also  terminate at that  time. The government  will  not  recoup  claims  paid  for  TRICARE  ECHO  benefits  provided  during 
the provisional period. 2.43.4.  EHHC plan of care. A written plan of care is required prior to authorizing TRICARE 
ECHO  home  healthcare.  The  plan  must  include  the  type,  frequency,  scope  and  duration  of the care  to  be  provided  and  support  the  professional  level  of  provider.  Reimbursement  will 
not be authorized for a level of provider not identified in the plan of care.  The plan of care will be reviewed for appropriateness whenever the MCSC is informed that the condition of 
the beneficiary has changed or there is otherwise a need to update the plan.  In all cases the beneficiary will be reassessed and the plan reviewed and updated at least every 90 days. 
2.43.5.  EHHC exclusions. 2.43.5.1.  General.   TRICARE   ECHO   Home   Healthcare   services   and   supplies   are 
excluded from those who are being provided continuing coverage of home healthcare as participants  of  the  former  Individual  Case  Management  Program  for  Persons  with 
Extraordinary Conditions (ICMP-PEC) or previous case management demonstrations. 2.43.5.2.  Respite  care.  Respite care  for  the  purpose  of  covering  primary  caregiver 
absences due to deployment, employment, seeking of employment or to pursue education 
----------------Page (70) Break----------------

is excluded.  Authorized respite  care  covers only the TRICARE ECHO beneficiary, not siblings or others who may reside in or be visiting in the beneficiary‘s residence. 
2.44.  TRICARE ECHO Cost-Share Liability. 2.44.1.  No deductible.  TRICARE ECHO benefits are not subject to a deductible amount. 
2.44.2.  Sponsor cost-share liability. Regardless of the number of family members receiving TRICARE  ECHO  benefits  or  TRICARE  ECHO  Home  Healthcare  in  a  given  month,  the 
sponsor‘s cost-share is listed on the TRICARE Internet Website. 2.44.2.1.  The Sponsor‘s cost-share will be applied to the first allowed TRICARE ECHO 
charges in any given month. The Government‘s share will be paid, up to the maximum amount specified in paragraph 2.45.3., for allowed charges after the sponsor‘s cost-share 
has been applied. 2.44.2.2.  The provisions of 32 CFR 199.18(d)(1) and (e)(1) regarding elimination of co-
payments for active duty family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime do not eliminate, reduce, or otherwise affect the sponsor‘s cost-share obligation. 
2.44.2.3.  The  sponsor‘s  cost-share   payment   amounts   do   not   accrue   to   the   Basic Program‘s Catastrophic Loss Protection under 10 U.S.C. § 1079(b)(5) as listed in 32 CFR 
199.4(f)(10) and 199.18(f). 2.44.3.  Government cost-share liability. 
2.44.3.1.  TRICARE  ECHO.  The  total  Government  share  of  the  cost  of  all  TRICARE ECHO benefits, except TRICARE ECHO home healthcare EHHC respite care, provided 
in  a  given  month  to  a  beneficiary  may  not  exceed  $2,500  after  application  of  the allowable payment methodology. 
2.44.3.2.  TRICARE ECHO home healthcare. 2.44.3.2.1.  The  maximum  annual  fiscal  year  Government  cost  share  per  EHHC-
eligible  beneficiary  for  TRICARE  ECHO  home  healthcare,  including  EHHC  respite care  may  not  exceed  the  local  wage-adjusted  highest  Medicare  Resource  Utilization 
Group  (RUG-III)  category  cost  for  care  in  a  TRICARE-authorized  skilled  nursing facility. 
2.44.3.2.2.  When  a  beneficiary  moves  to  a  different  locality  within  the  50  United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or Guam, the annual 
fiscal  year  cap  will  be  recalculated  to  reflect  the  maximum  established  under paragraph 2.44.3.2.1. for the beneficiary‘s new location and will apply to the EHHC 
benefit for the remaining portion of that fiscal year. 2.45.  TRICARE ECHO Benefit Payment. 
2.45.1.  Transportation.    The  allowable  amount  for  transportation  of  an  TRICARE  ECHO beneficiary is limited to the cost of the standard published fare plus any  standard surcharge 
made  to  accommodate  any  person  with  a  similar  disability  or  to  the  cost  of  specialized medical transportation when non-specialized transport cannot accommodate the beneficiary‘s 
qualifying  condition  related  needs,  or  when  specialized  transport  is  more  economical  than non-specialized  transport.  When  transport is  by  private  vehicle,  the  allowable  amount  is 
----------------Page (71) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   73  
limited to the Federal government employee mileage reimbursement rate in effect on the date the transportation is provided. 
2.45.2.  Equipment. 2.45.2.1.  The TRICARE allowable amount for durable equipment shall be calculated in 
the same manner as durable medical equipment allowable through 32 CFR 199.4. 2.45.2.2.  Allocating equipment expense.  The TRICARE ECHO beneficiary (or sponsor 
or guardian acting on the beneficiary‘s behalf) may,  only  at  the  time  of  the  request  for authorization  of  equipment,  specify  how  the  allowable  cost  of  the  equipment  is  to  be 
allocated  as  a  TRICARE  ECHO  benefit.    The  entire  allowable  cost  of  the  authorized equipment  may  be  allocated in  the month  of purchase provided  the  allowable cost  does 
not  exceed  the  TRICARE  ECHO  maximum  monthly  benefit  of  $2,500  or  it  may  be prorated  regardless  of  the  allowable  cost.    Prorating  permits  the  allowable  cost  of 
TRICARE  ECHO -authorized  equipment  to  be  allocated such that  the  amount  allocated each  month  does  not  exceed  the  maximum  monthly  benefit.  The  accrued  amount  from 
these sections must also be applied against the government‘s annual fiscal year maximum of $36,000.00. 
2.45.2.2.1.  Maximum  period.  The  maximum  number  of  consecutive  months  during which the allowable cost may be prorated is the lesser of: 
2.45.2.2.1.1.  The number of months calculated by dividing the allowable cost for the  item  by  2,500,  then  doubling  the  resulting  quotient,  round  off  to  the  nearest 
whole number; or, 2.45.2.2.1.2.  The number of months of expected useful life of the equipment for 
the    requesting    beneficiary,    as    determined    by    the    Director,    TRICARE Management Activity or designee. 
2.45.2.2.2.  Alternative  allocation period.    The  allowable  equipment  cost  may  be allocated  monthly  in  any  amount  so  that  the  $2,500  maximum  allowable  monthly 
ECHO benefit or the maximum period under paragraph 2.45.2.2.1. is not exceeded. 2.45.2.2.3.  Authorization. 
2.45.2.2.3.1.  The amount allocated each month, as determined in accordance with paragraph 2.45.2.1. will be separately authorized as a TRICARE ECHO benefit. 
2.45.2.2.3.2.  An  item  of  durable  equipment  shall  not  be  authorized  when  such authorization  would  allow  cost-sharing  of  duplicate  equipment,  as  defined  in  32 
CFR 199.2, for the same beneficiary. 2.45.2.2.4.  Cost-share. A cost-share, as provided by paragraph 2.44.2., is required for 
each month in which a prorated amount is authorized. 2.45.2.2.5.  Termination.  The  sponsor‘s  monthly  cost-share   and   the   prorated 
equipment  expense  provisions  provided  by  paragraphs  2.43.  and  2.44.  shall  be terminated as of the first day of the month following the death of a beneficiary or as 
of  the  effective  date of a beneficiary‘s loss of TRICARE ECHO eligibility for any other reason.

2.45.3.  For-profit  institutional  care  provider.    Institutional  care  provided  by  a  for-profit entity may be allowed only when the care for a specific TRICARE ECHO beneficiary: 
2.45.3.1.  Is  contracted  by  a  public  facility  as  a  part  of  a  publicly  funded  long-term inpatient care program; and, 
2.45.3.2.  Is provided based upon the TRICARE ECHO beneficiary‘s being eligible for the publicly funded program which has contracted for the care; and, 
2.45.3.3.  Is authorized by the public facility as a part of a publicly funded program; and, 2.45.3.4.  Is a cost-share liability in the absence of TRICARE eligibility; and, 
2.45.3.5.  Produces  a  TRICARE  ECHO  beneficiary  cost-share  liability  that  does  not exceed the maximum charge by the provider to the public facility for the contracted level 
of care. 2.45.4.  TRICARE ECHO home healthcare and EHHC respite care. 
2.45.4.1.  TRICARE-authorized  home  health  agencies  must  provide  and  bill  for  all authorized home healthcare services through established TRICARE claims mechanisms. 
No special billing arrangements will be authorized in conjunction with coverage that may be provided by Medicaid or other federal, state, community or private programs. 
2.45.4.2.  For authorized TRICARE ECHO home healthcare and respite care, TRICARE will reimburse the allowable charges or negotiated rates. 
2.45.4.3.  The  maximum  monthly  Government  reimbursement  for  EHHC,  including EHHC respite care, will be based on the number of hours of EHHC services rendered in 
the month, but in no case will it exceed one-twelfth of the annual maximum Government cost share as determined in this section. 
2.45.5.  Other Requirements.  Active duty sponsors must register potential TRICARE ECHO eligible  beneficiaries  through  the  Director,  TRICARE  Management  Activity  or  designee 
prior to receiving TRICARE ECHO benefits. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity or  designee  will  determine  TRICARE  ECHO  eligibility  and  update  DEERS  accordingly. 
Sponsors must provide evidence of enrollment in the Exceptional  Family  Member Program provided by their branch of Service  at the time they  register their family  member(s) for the 
TRICARE ECHO. 2.46.  TRICARE   ECHO   Benefit   Authorization.  All   TRICARE   ECHO   benefits   require 
authorization  by  the  Director,  TRICARE  Management  Activity  or  designee  prior  to  receipt  of such benefits. 
2.46.1.  Documentation.  The  sponsor  shall  provide  such  documentation  as  the  Director, TRICARE  Management  Activity  or  designee  requires  as  a  prerequisite  to  authorizing 
TRICARE ECHO benefits. Such documentation shall describe how the requested benefit will contribute  to  confirming,  arresting, or  reducing  the  disabling  effects  of  the  qualifying 
condition,  including  maintenance  of  function  or  prevention  of  further  deterioration  of function, of the beneficiary. 
2.46.2.  Format. An authorization issued by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee   shall   specify   such   description,   dates,   amounts,   requirements,   limitations   or 
----------------Page (73) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   75  
information   as   necessary   for   exact   identification   of   approved   benefits   and   efficient adjudication of resulting claims. 
2.46.3.  Valid  period.  An  authorization  for  TRICARE  ECHO  benefits  shall  be  valid  until such time as  the Director,  TRICARE  Management  Activity  or  designee  determines  that  the 
authorized  services  are  no  longer  appropriate  or  required  or  the  beneficiary  is  no  longer eligible under paragraph 2.42.1. 
2.46.4.  Authorization  waiver.  The  Director,  TRICARE  Management  Activity  or  designee may  waive  the  requirement  for  a  written  authorization  for  rendered  TRICARE  ECHO 
benefits  that,  except  for  the  absence  of  the  written  authorization,  would  be  allowable  as  a TRICARE ECHO benefit. 
2.46.5.  Public facility use. 2.46.5.1.  An TRICARE ECHO beneficiary must demonstrate that a public facility is not 
available and adequate to meet the needs of the beneficiary‘s qualifying condition(s) in the beneficiary‘s state of residency.  Such requirement shall apply to beneficiaries who 
request  authorization  for  training,  rehabilitation,  special  education,  assistive  technology, and institutional care in private nonprofit, public, and state institutions and facilities, and 
if  appropriate,  transportation  to  and  from  such  institutions  and  facilities.  The  maximum Government  cost  share  for  services  that  require  demonstration  of  public  facility  non-
availability   or   inadequacy   is   limited   to   $2,500   per   month   per   beneficiary.   State-administered  plans  for  medical  assistance  under  Title  XIX  of  the  Social  Security  Act 
(Medicaid)  are  not  considered  available  and  adequate  facilities  for  the  purpose  of  this section. 
2.46.5.2.  The  domicile  of  the  beneficiary  shall  be  the  basis  for  the  determination  of public facility availability when the sponsor and beneficiary are separately domiciled due 
to  the  sponsor‘s  move  to  a  new  permanent  duty  station  or  due  to  legal  custody requirements. 
2.46.5.3.  Written certification,  in  accordance  with  information  requirements,  formats, and procedures established by the director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee 
that  requested  TRICARE  ECHO  services  or  items  cannot  be  obtained  from  public facilities because the services or items are not available and adequate, is a prerequisite for 
TRICARE ECHO benefit payment for training, rehabilitation, special education, assistive technology,  and  institutional  care  in  private  nonprofit,  public,  and  state  institutions  and 
facilities, and if appropriate, transportation to and from such institutions and facilities. 2.46.5.3.1.  An   administrator   or   designee   of   a   public   facility   may   make   such 
certification for a beneficiary residing within the service area of that public facility. 2.46.5.3.2.  The   Director,   TRICARE   Management   Activity   or   designee   may 
determine,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  that  apparent  public  facility  availability  or adequacy for a requested type of service or item cannot be substantiated for a specific 
beneficiary‘s request for TRICARE ECHO benefits and therefore is not available. 2.46.5.3.2.1.  A   case-specific   determination   shall   be   based   upon   a   written 
statement  by  the  beneficiary  (or  sponsor  or  guardian  acting  on  behalf  of  the beneficiary)   which details   the   circumstances   wherein   a   specific   individual 
----------------Page (74) Break----------------
  76  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
representing  a  specific  public  facility  refused  to  provide  a  public  facility  use certification, and such other information as the Director, TRICARE Management 
Activity or designee determines to be material to the determination. 2.46.5.3.2.2.  A  case-specific  determination  of  public  facility  availability  by  the 
Director,  TRICARE  Management  Activity  or  designee  is  conclusive  and  is  not subject to appeal under 32 CFR 199.10. 
2.46.5.3.3.  Repair or maintenance of beneficiary owned durable equipment is exempt from the public facility use certification requirements. 
2.46.5.3.4.  The requirements of this paragraph notwithstanding, no public facility use certification  is  required  for  services  and  items  that  are  provided under Part  C  of  the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in accordance with the Individual Family Services Plan and that are otherwise allowable under the TRICARE ECHO. 
2.47.  Transitional  Assistance  Management  Program  (TAMP).  See  further  sponsor  service affiliation for DEERS enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement in AFI 36-3026V1_IP. 
2.47.1.  The   Transitional   Assistance   Management   Program   (TAMP)   offers   transitional TRICARE  coverage  to certain  separating  Active  Duty  Service  Members (ADSM) and  their 
eligible  family  members.    TAMP  coverage  by  default  is  TRICARE  Standard,  however, certain  TAMP  eligibles  may  enroll  or  re-enroll  in  TRICARE  Prime.    During  TAMP, 
beneficiaries are still eligible for active duty programs (e.g., TRICARE ECHO). 2.47.2.  In  accordance  with  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2005, 
effective  Oct.  28,  2004,  TRICARE  eligibility  under  the  TAMP  has  been  permanently extended from 60 or 120 days to 180 days. 
2.47.3.  Covered TAMP groups are: 2.47.3.1.  Members  involuntarily  separated  from  active  duty  and  their  eligible  family 
members. 2.47.3.2.  Reserve  and  National  Guard  members,  collectively  known  as  the  Reserve 
Component (RC), separated from active duty after being called up or ordered in support of  a  contingency  operation  for  an  active  duty  period  of  more  than  30  days  and  their 
family members. 2.47.3.3.  Members  separated  from  active  duty  after  being  involuntarily  retained  in 
support of a contingency operation and their family members. 2.47.3.4.  Members  separated  from  active  duty  following  a  voluntary  agreement  to  stay 
on active duty for less than one year in support of a contingency mission and their family members. 
2.47.3.5.  A Service Member who receives a sole survivorship discharge as defined in 10, U.S.C. § 1074. 
2.47.3.6.  A Service Member who is separated from active duty who agrees to become a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of a Reserve Component. 
2.47.4.  Active  duty  sponsors  and  family  members enrolled  in  TRICARE  Prime who desire to  continue  their  enrollment  upon  the  sponsor‘s  separation  from  active  duty  status  are 
----------------Page (75) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   77  
required  to  reenroll.    To  re-enroll  in  TRICARE  Prime,  the sponsor  or  family  member must complete and submit a TRICARE Prime enrollment application. Under TAMP, former active 
duty  sponsors,  former  activated  reservists,  and  family  members  of  both  are  not  eligible  to enroll  or  reenroll  in  TRICARE  Prime  Remote  (TPR)  or  in  TRICARE  Prime  Remote  for 
Active Duty Family Members (TPRADFM) because both programs require the sponsor to be on active duty.  Under the TAMP, the sponsor is no longer on active duty and is treated as an 
active duty family member for benefits and cost sharing purposes.  The effective date shall be the date the sponsor separated from active duty as the intent is to ensure that Prime coverage 
is seamless. 2.47.5.  TPR  and  TPRADFM  are  not  available  during  the  transitional  health  benefit  under 
TAMP.  However, Members and Family Members who were enrolled in TPR or TPRADFM while on active duty  and are  eligible for  TAMP benefits, may  enroll in TRICARE Prime if 
they  live  in  a  TRICARE  Prime  coverage  area.    Prime  coverage  under  TAMP still  requires enrollment and is subject to the ―twentieth of the month‖ rule.  If an application for an initial 
enrollment  is  received  after  the  twentieth  day  of  the  month,  Prime  enrollment  benefits  will begin  on  the  first  day  of  the  second  month  after  the  month  in  which  the  application  was 
received by the regional contractor. 2.47.6.  Dental Coverage. 
2.47.6.1.  TAMP  does  not  provide  dental  coverage  for  former  ADSMs  or  ADFMs.  Former ADSMs may use a military Dental Treatment Facility (DTF) on a space-available 
basis or enroll in the premium-based TRICARE Dental Program (TDP).  Former ADFMs may purchase TDP coverage. 
2.47.6.2.  The TDP is a voluntary dental insurance program that is available to ADFMs, non-active  duty  National  Guard and  Reserve  Members,  and  family  members  of  non-
active  duty  National  Guard  and  Reserve  Members,  including  the  Individual  Ready Reserve. 
2.47.6.3.  Transitional dental benefits for Reserve Component Service Members (RCSM) on  active  duty  for  more  than 30  days  in  support  of  a  contingency  operation  have  been 
expanded  to  include  dental  care  in  DTFs;  DTF  referred  care  to  the  private  sector;  and authorized remote dental care in the private sector during the 180 day transitional health 
care period. Both DTF referred care and remote care will be administered by TRICARE's Active  Duty  Dental  Program  (ADDP).  TDP  eligibility  will  begin  after  the  transitional 
health care period ends. 2.47.7.  Eligibility  for  the  TAMP  for  sponsors  and  family  members  is  determined  by  the 
sponsor‘s Service branch and information in DEERS.  Sponsors may verify eligibility for themselves   and   their   family   members   by   visiting   or   contacting   the   nearest   military 
identification card issuing facility or contacting the Defense Manpower Data Center Support Office  toll  free  at  (800)  538-9552.    For  additional  TRICARE  benefit  information,  visit  the 
TRICARE  Internet  Web  site  at www.tricare.osd.mil or  contact  the  MMSO  or  regional managed care support contractor. 
2.48.  Reciprocal  Healthcare  Agreements.  Foreign  military  and  diplomatic  personnel  pay  for MTF inpatient medical care, unless the foreign country and the United States have entered into a 
reciprocal  healthcare  agreement  indicating alternative  arrangements.    Reciprocal  healthcare 
----------------Page (76) Break----------------
  78  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
agreements require that both countries provide a comparable level of healthcare to a comparable number of personnel. 
2.48.1.  To  obtain  a  current  listing  of  reciprocal  healthcare  agreements  between  the  United States Department of Defense and foreign countries, please visit the Force Health Protection 
and          Readiness          Policy          and          Programs          Office          website          at [https://private.fhp.osd.mil/portal/rhas.jsp].  If your browser is unable to open the website 
from  this  hyperlink,  please  copy  the  URL  and  paste  into  the  URL  address  line  on  your browser.  Additionally, this secure Internet website may only be accessed from official DoD 
computer systems. 2.48.2.  As  additional  agreements  are  completed,  AFMSA/SG3SA  will  send  the  necessary 
information via message to MAJCOM Command Surgeons and/or AFMOA. 2.49.  Medically   Related   Services.  Sections   9271   and   1401   of   Title   20,   U.S.C.   entitles 
handicapped  DoD  Dependents  Schools  (DoDDS)  students  to  a  free  public  education.    Federal Law also entitles handicapped DoDDS students who require medically related services and are in 
a ―tuition free‖ status under DoD Directive 1342.13 Eligibility Requirements for  Education  of Minor  Dependents  in  Overseas  Areas  July  8,  1982,  with  Changes  1  and  2,  to  receive  those 
medical  services  free  of  charge,  regardless  of  their  beneficiary  category,  or  the  location  of  the service. 
2.49.1.  Under DoD Instruction 1010.13, Provision of Medically Related Services to Children Receiving or Eligible to Receive Special Education in DoD Dependent Schools Outside the 
United  States  August  28,  1986,  with  Change  1,  and  DoD  Instruction  1342.12,  Provision  of Early Intervention and Special Education Services to Eligible DoD Dependents in Overseas 
Areas,  12  March  1996,  the  DoD  provides  medical  care  and  related  services  in-theater  in overseas  locations  according  to  MTF  capabilities.    When  a  handicapped  student  who  is 
entitled  to  government  medical  care  needs  an  evaluation  or  services  outside  the  theater, aeromedical  evacuation  of  that  student  and  an  accompanying  adult  to  and  from  CONUS  is 
free. The Air Force may also authorize commercial transportation of the handicapped student and accompanying adult. 
2.49.2.  Providing  medically  related  services  under Sections  9271  and  1401  of  20  US  Code must not disrupt the individual‘s special education. For evaluations performed in CONUS, 
consider  the  scope  of  the  law.    For  example,  ongoing  care  or  physical  therapy,  in  CONUS based  facilities,  is  likely  disruptive  and,  as  such,  inconsistent  with  the  law  and  DoD 
directives. As a result, in the extremely rare case of a handicapped DoD student who cannot obtain   required   ongoing   services   in-theater, command   must   consider   reassigning   the 
individual‘s sponsor to another accompanied area where the necessary medical services are available that do not disrupt the child‘s special education. 
2.50.  Authorization for Physical Examinations Other than  Flying.  This paragraph does not cover  the  physical  examinations  (flying,  non-flying  and  occupational  health)  addressed  in  AFI 
48-123, Medical Examination and Standards. 2.50.1.  The  MTF  Force  Health  Management  or  Medical  Standards  Management  Element 
(MSME)  functions  schedule  employment  physicals  when  the  MTF  Commander  determines that  MTF  personnel  are  available  and  an  official  of  the  sponsoring  agency  sends  a  written 
request  for  the  physical.    School  physicals  may  be  scheduled  by  the  appropriate  clinical 
----------------Page (77) Break----------------

management  function  when  the  MTF  Commander  determines  that  MTF  personnel  are available  and  an  official  of  the  sponsoring  agency  sends  a  written  request  for  the  physical.  
There is no charge to the individual for the physical.  Individuals who may receive physicals under this paragraph are: 
2.50.1.1.  Contract   food   service,   housekeeping,   and   other   healthcare   employees   or healthcare volunteers. 
2.50.1.2.  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  personnel  and  AAFES concessionaire employees. 
2.50.1.3.  Employees of Officer, Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) and Service Clubs. 2.50.1.4.  DoD School System teachers working on base or overseas in uniformed service 
schools that a US military department operates. 2.50.1.5.  Civilian contractors working in positions that require exposure to occupational 
hazards such as laser energy and/or toxic substances. 2.50.1.6.  Domestic   servants   of   uniformed   services   personnel.   MTF   personnel   will 
provide a  physical  for  these  domestic  servants  when  command  directives  require  it  as  a condition of employment, or the employer overseas requests it. 
2.50.1.7.  Non-appropriated fund (NAF) employees. 2.50.1.8.  Civilian employees may receive (at no charge to the individual) physicals for: 
2.50.1.8.1.  Required occupational health screening, fitness for duty  assessments and follow-up under the AFOSH. 
2.50.1.8.2.  DoD sponsored overseas assignments, when DoD requires it. 2.50.1.8.3.  DoD sponsored courses, when it is a course requirement. 
2.50.2.  The MTF also provides physicals for any individual on a DoD sponsored orientation flight IAW local and MAJCOM and/or AFMOA directives. 
2.50.3.  The  MTF  performs  physicals  to  determine if  a  person  is  qualified  for  duty  in  the uniformed  services  according  to  AFI  48-123.  MTF  specialty  clinics  will  also  perform 
examinations/physicals  as  necessary  to  determine  fitness  for  accession  to  active  duty  or  to apply to a service academy. 
2.50.4.  At  overseas  locations,  the  MTF  may  perform  premarital  physicals  for  intended spouses (ineligible beneficiaries), IAW AFI 36-2609, Marriage in Overseas Commands. 
2.50.5.  The  MTF  Commander  may  determine  that  providing  the  physical  or  immunization serves  the  best  interest  of  command  health.  If  necessary,  the  MTF  will  provide  physicals, 
health inspections and immunizations to ensure detection of any communicable disease at a uniformed services installation. 
2.50.6.  Under 31 U.S.C. § 1535, the MTF may provide physicals for applicants for: 2.50.6.1.  Foreign  Service  Posts.  The  State  Department  requests  physicals  for  Foreign 
Service  Officers  or  applicants  for  the  Foreign  Service  (including  family  members)  on Form  DSL-820,  Letter  of  Authorization  for  Medical  Examination  (two  copies).  Return 
the report of the physical examination as outlined in the DSL-820.

2.50.6.2.  Federal employment, when necessary to meet occupational requirements. 2.50.6.3.  Job  Corps  and  VISTA.  Appropriate  agency  officials  request  physicals.  The 
MTF  completes  the  appropriate  forms  as  requested  by  the  agency  and  returns  these reports to the requesting official.  The MTF provides five copies of DD Form 7A, Report 
of  Treatment  Furnished  Pay  Patients-Outpatients  Treatment  Furnished  Part  B  (RCS: HAF-SGH[M]7103), to HQ USAF/SG8Y for reimbursement and includes a copy of the 
request for physicals. 2.50.6.4.  Peace Corps. Peace Corps officials request physicals for volunteers and family 
members.  These are typically pre-selection, separation, or special physicals. 2.50.6.5.  Specific FAA physicals/examinations, performed by an MTF FAA-credentialed 
provider  or  Flight  Surgeon,  may  be  provided  at  the discretion  of  the MTF  Commander.  Requests  by FAA  Regional  office  officials  should  be  directed to  the MSME  section  for 
consideration.    Civilian  Air  Traffic  Controllers  (ATC)  who  are  contracted  to  work  in military  ATC  Facilities,  would  fall  under  this  paragraph.  (FAA  now  requires  that 
providers who perform FAA physicals apply and obtain a certification number). 2.50.6.6.  US Secret Service. The Chief, US Secret Service or a designated representative 
submits a written request for the MTF to perform the same type of periodic physical  as for  a  non-flying  officer  (AFI  44-170).    Send  one  copy  of  the  appropriate  forms  to  the 
Chief, US Secret Service, US Treasury Department, Washington DC 20220. 2.50.6.7.  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  applicants  and  investigative  personnel

IAW  reasons  identified  in  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examination  and  Standards  for  RCSMs. Many  RCSMs  must  travel  considerable  distances  to  obtain  these  services.  If  the  individual 
lives outside the MTF catchment area or more than 40 miles from the MTF, clinic/ancillary services  personnel must  complete the physical  and/or consultation in one  (1) day  (this does 
not include the completion of the paperwork or the administrative requirements necessary to properly  document  findings  and  final  written  evaluation,  only  the  clinical  testing,  physical 
evaluation, etc.). A traditional RCSM (not on EAD orders) but one who is obligated to one drill weekend a.k.a. Unit Training Assembly weekend per month) is generally only entitled to 
healthcare benefits identified in paragraphs 2.9. and 2.10. The RCSM‘s private-employer-sponsored health insurance provides routine medical care. 
2.50.8.  MTF personnel may authorize one-time ancillary services, such as drawing blood for individuals  who  are  not  beneficiaries,  if  the  service  is  part  of  an  evaluation  or  treatment 
program for an authorized beneficiary (e.g., a non-beneficiary who may be a potential organ or blood donor for an authorized beneficiary). 
2.50.9.  It is a civilian employee‘s responsibility to get an eye refraction exam for safety glasses.    Employees  must  present  their  civilian  prescriptions  to  the  MTF  to  obtain  safety 
glasses.  If  space  is  available,  the  MTF  may  provide  eye  refraction  or  contract  for  such services locally, if the MTF Commander feels it better serves the Government to do so.

2.50.10.  Upon  written  request  from  the  appropriate  government  agency,  the  MTF  provides physicals  for  individuals  who  have  filed  claims  against  the  Federal  Government.  These 
physicals are to determine the nature and extent of that individual‘s injuries or disabilities. 2.50.10.1.  If  the  individual  is  filing  a  claim  against  the  Army,  Navy,  Air  Force,  or 
Marine Corps or if a Congressman is considering filing for a private relief bill, there is no charge  for  this  examination  unless  it  results  in  an  admission.  In  that  case,  collect  the 
subsistence rate from the individual. 2.50.10.2.  If the individual is filing a claim against another government agency, the MTF 
completes a DD Form 7A for the IAR and sends it to AFMSA/SGY. 2.50.11.  When  the  government  considers  it  necessary  or  desirable  and  the  appropriate 
Commander  files  a  request,  the  MTF  performs  physicals,  based  on  space  availability  and capability, for civilians who are performing aircrew duties or flying in military aircraft. The 
following  individuals  may  receive  physicals  under  this  provision,  IAW  the  standards  and guidelines set forth in AFI 48-123 and the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR), Part 67, and 
in  the  Guide  for  Aviation  Medical  Examiners  published  by  the  FAA  Office  of  Aviation Medicine. 
2.50.11.1.  Employees  or  prospective  employees  of  government  contractors  whom  the government has approved for training in DoD facilities or for performing aircrew duties 
under the AFI 36 series or other DoD agency directives. 2.50.11.2.  Passengers  and  maintenance  personnel  flying  in  high  performance  aircraft 
under AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program. 2.50.11.3.  Civilian  employees  of,  or  under  contract  to,  the  DoD  or  other  government 
departments  or  agencies  who  have  been  approved  to  perform  aircrew  duties  or  receive instructions in such duties, under AFI 48-123. 
2.50.11.4.  DoD   test   pilots,   representatives   of   (or   persons   sponsored   by)   foreign governments,  other  non-US  citizens,  and  US  citizens  not  a  part  of  the  DoD  who  have 
been otherwise approved for flying aircraft under appropriate flying management AFIs or comparable non-DoD directives. 
2.51.  Care  of  Minors.  MTF  personnel  may  treat  minors  without  parental  consent  for  routine care as allowed by applicable state and local laws or other federal regulations applicable to such 
care.  MTF Commanders overseas must consult the base Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and have a written policy available before treating minors without parental consent. 
2.51.1.  MTF  providers  may  treat  minors  without  parental  consent,  if  unable  to  contact  the parent  or  legal  guardian, in  a  medical  emergency  when  failure  to  treat  would  result  in 
potential loss of life, limb, or sight.   Two Medical Corps (MC) officers should concur with the  need  for  emergency  treatment  when  possible.    Do  not  delay  care  for  a  second  opinion 
when such delay could result in loss of life, limb, or sight.  Contact the parent(s) as soon as possible after treatment. 
2.51.2.  When  needed  or  appropriate,  substitute  a  properly  executed  limited  power  of attorney (medical power of attorney) for parental consent.

2.52.  Elective Civilian Medical Care for Active Duty Members. 2.52.1.  Elective medical and dental care provided at civilian medical facilities or from other 
civilian sources is not authorized at the government‘s expense.  Service Members who seek medical/dental   care   outside   the   Military   Health   System   without   prior   approval   or 
coordination  with  the MTF  responsible for  their  primary  care,  do  so  at  their  own risk.  Any unfavorable outcome resulting from elective care provided by civilian sources could result in 
a  not-in-line-of  duty  finding  and  potentially  impact  disability  benefits.    Service  Members must arrange for the civilian medical facility to send a summary of treatment to the servicing 
MTF.    All  members  assigned  or  attached  to  a  sensitive  duty  program,  e.g.,  the  Personnel Reliability  Program  (PRP),  Presidential  Support  (PSP)  Program,  or  other  national  security 
dependent  program,  must  obtain  written  permission  from  their  unit  Commander  and  local MTF  Commander  prior  to  treatment.    If approved,  personnel  in  these  uniquely  critical 
programs  must  have  their  treatment  reviewed  by  the  MTF  PRP  consultant  or  designated competent   medical   authority.   Protected   Health   Information   disclosures   to   command 
authorities will be tracked in accordance with DoD 6025.18-R. 2.52.2.  Prior to any elective treatment from the MHS, a Service Member must consult with a 
competent military medical authority.  A Service Member who elects to have elective care or treatment provided at his or her own expense may  not be  eligible  for compensation for any 
adverse  residuals  resulting  from  the  elected  treatment.    A  record  of  the  counseling  will  be made  by  the  BCAC  or  other  designated  individual  to  document  that  the  member  was 
counseled  about  the  elective  treatment and  his  or  her  subsequent  potential  ineligibility  for disability   compensation   for   any   adverse   residuals   incurred   secondary   to   the   elective 
treatment. 2.52.3.  The MTF Commander, after consultation with the member‘s PCM and/or specialist, 
may request a case review by the Deployment Availability Working Group (DAWG) prior to the Service Member‘s anticipated episode of civilian healthcare if there is concern about the 
Service Member‘s current fitness for duty.  This action serves to provide documentation  of preexisting medical conditions should the future risk of a finding of Not Fit for Duty and the 
need for a disability evaluation be deemed likely. 2.52.4.  If the Service Member suffers complications and presents to the MTF for treatment, 
the healthcare required to resolve the complication is authorized and the MTF must provide care for the Service Member unless the later care or procedure(s)  are  elective in nature  and 
not medically necessary.  If complications jeopardize the member‘s fitness for  duty,  the Service  Member‘s  commander  may  request  an  MEB.    If  the  member  requires  further 
convalescent  time because  of  a  complication,  the  Service  Member  should  be  recommended for convalescent leave.  If the complication requires hospitalization the Service Member must 
be placed in hospital inpatient status. 2.52.5.  Ordinary  leave  for  lost  time  may  be  required  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-3003, 
Military  Leave Program.  Note:  If an Airmen  elects childbirth from  civilian sources at her own expense (hospitalization or home delivery), the mother must take ordinary leave to cover 
any  period  of  time  lost  from  duty  before  delivery.    The  attending  provider  recommends convalescent leave IAW AFI 36-3003 and AFI 44-102. 
2.52.6.  For more additional information regarding elective civilian medical care, refer to AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program.

2.53.  Administration Requirements for Organ Donation Requests. 2.53.1.  Active Duty Service Members who wish to donate one or more of their organs, must: 
2.53.1.1.  Be  made  aware  of  the  risks  and  benefits  of  the  procedure,  including  where complications  might  limit  or  prohibit  further  active  duty  service.    The  Service  Member 
must provide a letter requesting to be an organ donor.  The request must be coordinated with  the  unit  commander,  the  local  MTF  Commander,  and  the  MAJCOM  Command 
Surgeon before forwarding to the AFMOA Commander. 2.53.2.  The   MTF   Commander   ensures   the   member   has   the   permission   of   his/her 
commander.    The  Airman  is  required  to  submit  a  request  letter  to  their  unit  Commander identifying  what  organ(s)  is  to  be  donated  and  to  whom.    The  unit  commander  must 
approve/disapprove the request. 2.53.3.  Unit  commander  permission  is  documented  on  an  endorsement  or  approval  letter 
addressed to the MTF Commander.  The unit permission or authorization letter becomes part of the approval package.  The unit commander must document that his/her mission will not 
be  significantly  impacted  because  of  the  requestor‘s  departure  during  the  procedure  or afterwards, during the recovery period. 
2.53.4.  The MTF Commander is also responsible for documenting (e.g., endorsement letter) that the member can be expected to remain deployable or physically qualified for ―worldwide 
duty‖ after a reasonable recovery period following the donation - assuming  no  unforeseen complications exist.  The letter must be  forwarded to the AFMOA Commander, along with 
the  member‘s  request,  and  the  unit  commander‘s  approval  letter.    MTF‘s  will  track disclosures in accordance with DoD 6025.18-R. 
2.53.5.  A Service Member who elects to have such treatment done at his or her own expense will likely not be eligible for compensation from any adverse residual complications resulting 
from the elected treatment, unless it can be demonstrated that such election was reasonable or resulted from a significant impairment of judgment that can be attributed or is the product of 
a ratable medical condition.  A record of the counseling will be made by the BCAC or other designated  individual  to  document  that  the  member  was  counseled  about  the  elective 
treatment and his or her subsequent ineligibility for disability compensation for any adverse residuals incurred secondary to the elective treatment. 
2.53.6.  The  request  for  organ  donation  along  with  the  unit  commander‘s  approval  and documentation  of  the  required  counseling  identified  above  must  be  sent  per  AFI  44-102 
guidance. 2.53.7.  Organ  donors  may  have  permissive  TDY  to  travel,  inpatient  status  for  the  surgery, 
and convalescent leave for the recovery IAW AFI 36-3003.  See AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management for further information regarding organ donation. 
2.54.  Abortions. 2.54.1.  The Air Force Medical Service restricts abortions to cases in which the mother‘s life 
would be endangered if she carried the fetus to term.  If there is a significant chance that the mother‘s life is in jeopardy, MTFs are authorized to perform the procedure  with  MTF 
Commander approval.  No pre-payment for inpatient care is required.  Services and supplies

related  to  spontaneous,  missed  or  threatened  abortions  and  abortions  related  to  ectopic pregnancies may be provided.  Refer to the TRICARE Policy Manual Chapter 4. 
2.54.1.1.  Overseas  MTFs  may  perform  prepaid  abortions  only  in  cases  where  the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.  Refer to AFI 44-102 for additional information. 
2.55.  Artificial  Insemination.  Except in cases  meeting the requirements of the Health Affairs Policy  for  Assisted  Reproductive  Services  for  the  Benefit  of  Seriously  or  Severely  Ill/Injured  
(category  II  or  III)  Active  Duty  Service  members,  dated 3  April  2012,  the use of  supplemental healthcare  funds  for  Artificial Insemination  (AI)  is  not  authorized.  In  limited  cases  outside  the 
scope of the Heath Affairs policy for Assisted Reproductive Services for the Benefit of Seriously or  Severely  Ill/Injured  (category  II  or  III)  Active  Duty  Service  members,  Air  Force  teaching 
facilities may provide AI with husband‘s semen (AIH). Artificial Insemination using semen from an unknown donor (AID) cannot be performed using military funding.   Medical care continues 
for  women  who  become  pregnant  as  a  result  of  artificial  insemination.  Availability  of  care  is based on their beneficiary category. 
2.56.  Sperm Cell or Spermatozoa Frozen Storage.  Temporary and/or long-term frozen sperm storage for male beneficiaries undergoing cancer treatment (including Active Duty and Reserve 
Component)  is  not  authorized.    Air  Force  payment  or  reimbursement  for  said  storage  is  not authorized. 
2.57.  TRICARE  Coverage  of  Surrogate  Pregnancies.  The  Office  of  the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, by letter published 29 April 2009 and accompanying Information 
Paper  on  TRICARE  Coverage  of  Surrogate  Pregnancies,  established  DoD  policy  regarding TRICARE coverage of surrogate pregnancies. 
2.57.1.  There is nothing in law, regulation, or policy that prohibits military family members from engaging in surrogate pregnancies. 
2.57.2.  Policy  specifies  that  surrogate  pregnancies  resulting  from  contractual  arrangements are subject to statutory limitations on TRICARE being a second payer to all other health plan 
coverage. 2.57.2.1.  TRICARE policy Manual, Chapter 4, Section 8.1., Paragraph III.D. 
2.57.2.2.  TRICARE Reimbursement Manual, Chapter 4, Section 4, Paragraph XIV. 2.57.3.  TRICARE considers a contract for surrogacy to be ―other health insurance‖ (OHI) 
and cost shares accordingly. 2.57.3.1.  Applies when the contract requires the adoptive parents to pay all or part of the 
medical  expenses of  the  surrogate mother  as  well  as  when  contractual  arrangements  for payment do not specifically address reimbursement for the mother‘s medical care. 
2.57.3.2.  TRICARE  will  cost  share  on  the  remaining  balance  of  otherwise-covered benefits related to the surrogate mother‘s medical expenses after the contractually agreed 
upon arrangement has been exhausted. 2.57.3.2.1.  Value of the OHI is considered to be the amount specified in the contract 
for  medical  care  or,  in  the  absence  of  a  specified  amount,  the  full  amount  of  all undersigned payments. 
2.57.4.  Identifying a surrogate pregnancy has proven to be problematic. 
----------------Page (83) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   85  
2.57.4.1.  If  information  gained  after  the  delivery  reveals  the  pregnancy  to  have  been  a surrogate  one,  either  the  MTF  or  the  managed  care  support  contractor,  as  appropriate, 
must undertake recoupment action. 2.58.  Intersex   Surgery.  (Reference   TRICARE   Policy   Manual   6010.54-M,   1   Aug   2002, 
Chapter 4, Section 16.2., Surgery, Intersex Surgery).  Authority: 32 CFR 199.4(e)(7) and (g)(29). 2.58.1.  Surgery performed to correct sex gender confusion (e.g., ambiguous genitalia) which 
has been documented to be present at birth is a covered benefit. 2.58.2.  Exclusion.    All  services  and  supplies  directly  and  indirectly  related  to  intersex 
surgery  for  other  than  ambiguous  genitalia  documented  to  be  present  at  birth  are  excluded from cost-sharing and are not provided at Air Force MTFs.

Chapter 3 
TRICARE OPERATIONS 
Section 3A—Access to Care Guidance 
3.1.  Access to Care (ATC) Standards. 3.1.1.  Access  to  care  for  our  beneficiaries  is  a  top  priority  for  the  Military  Health  System 
(MHS). All enrolled beneficiaries (including active duty), regardless of their location, should be afforded ATC according to the standards published in 32 CFR 199.17.  See AFI 44-176, 
Access to the Care Continuum for additional information. 3.1.2.  The ATC standards are: 
3.1.2.1.  Acute  Care  Access:    to  be  provided  within  24  continuous  hours  from  the patient‘s request. 
3.1.2.2.  Routine  Care  Access:    To  be  provided  within  one  week  (seven  calendar  days) from the patient‘s request. 
3.1.2.3.  Specialty/Wellness Care Access:  To be provided within four weeks (28 calendar days) from the patient‘s request. 
3.1.3.  MTF  and  TRICARE  authorized  providers have  the  authority  to  determine  what category  of  care  (acute  or  routine)  is  required  for  a  given  healthcare  need,  even  if  it  is 
different from the patient‘s original request.  In other words, if the patient calls in for an acute appointment and a provider determines, based upon his or her own training, experience, 
and appropriate criteria that a routine appointment is merited, the routine appointment will be offered.  The provider should document the logic behind the decision in the patient‘s medical 
record. 3.1.4.  In  most  circumstances  the  beneficiary  will  speak  to  an  appointing  agent.    The 
appointing agent should make every effort to accommodate the patient‘s access to care request (e.g., if the beneficiary requests an acute appointment and one is available, it should 
be offered regardless of branch or service affiliation). 3.1.5.  Military Health System‘s (MHS) Guide to Access Success.  A MHS Guide to Access 
Success  developed  by  the  AFMS  is  available  for  download  from  the  Health  Benefits Knowledge  Junction  at https://kx.afms.mil/healthbenefits.    This  guide  provides  all  the 
information needed to successfully manage access to care programs in any AFMS MTF and its use is mandatory. 
3.2.  Specialty Care Access Standards. 3.2.1.  32  CFR  199.17(p)(5)(ii)  states  that  ―wait  time  for  an  appointment  for  the  initial 
routine specialty care referral shall not exceed four weeks.‖  To meet the access to care standard,  the  MTF  or  the  Managed  Care  Support  Contractor  (MCSC)  would,  upon  being 
contacted   by   either   the   patient   or   referring   provider,   have   to   offer   a   specialty   care appointment within four weeks of the date of that request. 
----------------Page (85) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   87  
3.2.2.  Wait  time  begins  from  the  date  the  TRICARE Service  Center/Healthcare  Finder,  an MTF,  or  a  provider  is  contacted  for  an  appointment  either  by  the  patient  or  referring 
provider. 3.2.3.  Patients  should  be  strongly  encouraged  to  go  to  the  MTF's  Referral  Management 
Center  (RMC)  to  process  and  get  instructions  regarding  their  specialty  care  referral.    The MTF is responsible to track and account for all its referrals. 
3.2.4.  The MTF need only to offer one MTF appointment within the access to care standards to  fulfill  its  duty  to  provide  care  within  the  access  standards.    If  multiple  and  convenient 
appointment  choices  are  available,  whenever  possible,  the  patient  should  be  offered  more than one option that meets the access to care standard.  Moreover, if the patient is unable to 
accept  the initial  appointment  offered,  the  patient  should  be  offered  the  next  available appointment thereafter.  Appointing staff should be trained to use access to care measurement 
features  of  the  CHCS  to  accurately  document  timeliness  of  services  and  patient  refusals  of appointments within access standards. 
3.2.4.1.  Once  offered  an  MTF  appointment,  the  Prime  patient,  except  active  duty,  may choose to exercise their point of service option. 
3.2.5.  A provider‘s professional judgment cannot waive the standards.  There is no provision for  waiving  the  standards,  which  are  fixed  by  regulation  and  incorporated  into  the  MCSC 
contracts.  While the provider cannot relieve any entity of its obligations under the access to care  standards,  the  provider  can,  exercising  his  or  her  professional  judgment,  advise  the 
patient of his or her opinion that a condition is amenable to a greater than four week wait for an appointment time.  If a patient accepts that opinion, the patient would have the option of 
declining timely offered appointments as discussed above. 3.2.6.  A  contractor  may  request  exceptions  to  the  requirement  to  make  specialty  services 
available  within  the  network  if  they  are  not  sufficiently  available  in  the  area  to  make inclusion  practical.    However,  absent  such  an  exception,  the  contractor  is  bound  by  the 
network adequacy standards. If the network is legally and contractually adequate, but there is still  no  ability  to  provide  an  appointment  in  the  MTF  or  network  within  four  weeks,  the 
appropriate solution is for the MCSC to refer the patient to an non-network provider within the access to care standards or to give the patient the option, with the referring provider‘s 
concurrence, of waiting for a network appointment. 3.3.  Non-Availability Statements. 
3.3.1.  To  obtain  information  regarding  Non-availability  Statement  management,  visit  the TRICARE.mil  website  or  review  DoD  Manual  6010.54-M,  TRICARE  Policy  Manual, 
Chapter  1,  Section  6.1.  Non-availability  Statement  (DD  Form  1251)  for  Inpatient  Care  and Chapter 12, Section 2.1., Benefits and Beneficiary Payments. 
Section 3B—Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator (BCAC) 
3.4.  BCAC  General  Roles  and  Responsibilities.  As  developed  between  the  Services  and TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), the following are general roles and responsibilities that 
BCACs are expected to follow when completing their duties.

either  administrative  reasons  (e.g.,  LOD,  MEB,  etc...)  or  specialty  care,  the  MTF becomes  clinically  responsible  for  that  patient.    If  the  MTF  subsequently  refers  the 
patient to the local network, while maintaining clinical oversight of the patient‘s care, the approval/authorization process rests with the referring MTF.  Under no circumstance will 
the Service Point of Contact (SPOC) at the Military Medical Support Office (MMSO) be asked to place an authorization into the system for a TPR enrolled patient when an MTF 
initiated the referral.  If the patient‘s clinical needs exceed the MTFs oversight capability, care  management  is  returned  to  the  civilian  PCM  through  the  SPOC.    These  same 
guidelines  apply to  RC  personnel  referred  to  our  MTFs  for  medical  and  administrative support. 
3.15.2.2.  The  supporting  MTF  Commander  has  direct  control  of  patient  travel  funding for GSU members as outlined in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation. 
3.15.3.  Access to Care and Referral Times: 3.15.3.1.  Refer  to  3.1.  for  Access  to  Care  standards  and  3.2.  for  Specialty  Care  Access 
Standards. 
Section 3F—Medical In/Out-Processing Program 
3.16.  Overview. 3.16.1.  The DoD has established policy that all military service members will be apprised of 
their  healthcare  benefits  as  they  move  from  one  assignment  to  another.    Specifically, members must  be  informed of  the scope  of  their benefits;  how to  access  healthcare  in  their 
local community; how to access healthcare while away from home or enroute to a new duty station;  and  how  to  get  problems  resolved  during  this  transitional  period  should  they  arise.  
Furthermore,  medical  in/out-processing  appointments,  briefings,  and  meetings  offer MTF providers and preventative healthcare specialists with an opportunity to collect, review,  and 
assess a Service Member and his/her family members‘ health status to identify significant medical  or  dental  conditions  or  complications  that  may  have  otherwise  gone  unnoticed  or 
untreated if the medical in/out-processing review had not been completed. 3.16.2.  MTF  Commanders  will  establish  medical  in/out-processing  programs  designed  to 
ensure  enrolled  beneficiaries  have  a  basic  understanding  of  their  individual  health  benefits, the MTF‘s capabilities, and a basic overview of preventative health programs available to 
patients.    MTF  Commanders  will  also  ensure  MTF  staff  members  are  familiar  with  the typical  subject  issues  and  topics  discussed  at  in/out-processing  briefings.    Staff  members 
should  have  a  basic  understanding  of  TRICARE  benefit  options  and  be  able  to  clearly communicate these options to beneficiaries when required – or at least know to refer patients 
who have TRICARE enrollment or general health benefits questions to the appropriate office to  obtain  further  information.    Health  benefits  briefings  may  be  combined  with  other 
installation  information  briefings  normally   provided  to  arriving  and  departing  service members.      A   good   example   of   an   in-processing  briefing  opportunity  is  the  ―base 
newcomer‘s‖ briefing or Right Start Program briefing.  These types of briefings are normally held  at  installation  theaters,  officer  and  enlisted  clubs,  or  any  other  suitable  locations  of 
opportunity  that  assure  maximum  participation  and/or  compliment  existing  installation in/out-processing   policies.      Although   not   specifically   limited   as   an   exclusive   TOPA 
----------------Page (97) Break----------------

obligation, generally, MTF staff members assigned to the TOPA function are responsible for providing  the  healthcare  benefits  portion  of  each  in/out-processing  function.    Individual 
medical health status questionnaires or personal assessments obtained by TOPA personnel at any  in/out-processing  briefing  are  to  be  forwarded  to  locally  identified  MTF  providers  and 
preventative  healthcare  specialists  so  appropriate  continuity  of  care  health  assessments  can be  accomplished.    The  MTF  TOPA  function  is  specifically  responsible  for  providing  a

Chapter 4 
PATIENT ADMINISTRATION FUNCTIONS 
Section 4A—Legal Aspects of Protected Health Information and Release of Information 
4.1.  Safeguarding Medical Information and Health Record Custody and Control. 4.1.1.  Maintaining  custody  and  control  of  original  medical,  dental,  and  inpatient  records.  
The  information  contained  in  outpatient  medical,  dental  and  inpatient  treatment  records  is personal  to  the  individual  and  will  be  properly  safeguarded.  Take  necessary  precautions  to 
avoid  compromise  of  medical  information  during  the  movement  of  the  record  inside  and outside the MTF.  Only medical personnel are authorized access to the information except as 
noted  throughout  this  chapter.    Original  health  records  are  not  to  be  released  to  anyone outside the MTF without specific and verifiable operational mission related, legal or medical 
necessity  requirements.    See  DoDI  6040.43,  Custody  and  Control  of  Outpatient  Medical Records for additional guidance. 
4.1.2.  Limit  access  to  all  open  record  storage  areas  and  to  electronic  records  to  authorized personnel  only.  Authorized  personnel  are  defined  as  personnel  who,  through  a  verification 
process,  have  presented  a  valid  requirement  to  access  medical  records.    Personnel  granted access must be fully aware of the requirements in this instruction regarding safeguarding PHI 
maintained  in  the  MTF.    Furthermore,  MTF  Commander  approval/authorization  is  required for  unescorted  access  to  medical  records  areas.    Written  authorization  must  be  posted  near 
each entrance for ready reference.  If commander‘s written authorization is required prior to electronic access ID card ―swipe‖ activation, individuals with ID card swipe access do not 
need to be identified on the posted listing.  This does not apply to keypad access due to the potential for security compromise. 
4.1.3.  Establish  written procedures  to  ensure  highly  sensitive records and  sensitive medical information are safeguarded.  This includes copying electronic records for inclusion into the 
hard-copy record, safeguarding x-rays and fetal monitoring strips.  Drug  and alcohol abuse, rape, child or adult abuse and possible claims against the government are examples of highly 
sensitive records.  Information which may affect the patient‘s morale, character, medical progress  or  mental  health  is  considered  sensitive.  To  protect  the  sensitive  nature  of  the 
information, ensure that sensitive records or documents are only handled directly by medical personnel when advised by the attending physician or MTF Commander. 
4.1.3.1.  Role-based  access  procedures.  Each  MTF  will  develop  policies  and  procedures for defining levels of access to paper and electronic health information by individuals or 
groups  of  individuals  (work  centers)  based  on  requirements  in  fulfillment  of  assigned duties. At a minimum, guidance should address: 
4.1.3.1.1.  Standardized    matrix    for    evaluating    specific    roles    against    access requirements. 
4.1.3.1.2.  Review and approval process, to include approval authority. 4.1.3.1.3.  Procedures for periodically validating access requirements. 
4.1.3.1.4.  Termination procedures.

4.1.3.2.  Protection of PHI. MTFs must evaluate and implement administrative, technical and  physical  safeguards  to  reasonably  protect  health  information  from  unauthorized  use 
or disclosure, and to limit instances of incidental disclosure. 4.1.4.  Sequestering Health Records.  Sequestering a health record is the storage and securing 
of a health record separate from other health records for added security or for legal purposes.  The  MTF  may  sequester  the  original  medical  record  or  a  certified  copy  when  the  situation 
warrants.  A notice should be placed on the original record to ensure personnel do not allow the patient to hand-carry the record while there is an active claim or litigation.  If a certified 
copy is made for sequestering, return the original record to the file room and suspense it for periodic updates.  Records will be sequestered under the following conditions: 
4.1.4.1.  When an administrative claim or law suit claim against the government has been filed. 
4.1.4.2.  When  a  patient  has  tried  to  tamper,  alter  or  illegally  remove  a  record  from  the facility. 
4.1.4.3.  When  a  request  is  received  from  an  attorney  under  circumstances  indicating claim or law suit is being considered. 
4.1.4.4.  When  an  Inspector  General  (IG)  or  Congressional  Inquiry  or  Investigation  has been initiated. 
4.1.4.5.  When the record becomes relevant to an Office of Special Investigation (OSI) or Security  Forces  investigation.    Annotate  sequestered  record  form with  the  OSI/Security 
Forces  agent‘s  name  and  case  number  for  annual  review  process.    For  all  other government investigative agency inquiries, refer to paragraph 4.5. and the DoD 6025.18-
R,        Health        Information        Privacy        Regulation        Internet        website        at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/602518r.pdf.  Contact the local SJA, in-
house MLC or HIPAA Privacy Officer for questions. 4.1.4.5.1.  For  purposes  of  safety  or  mishap investigations,  sequestration  of  medical 
records in a manner similar to the previous paragraphs is not automatically required.  However,  all  efforts  should  be  made  to  secure  and  provide  copies  of  pre-incident 
records to all appropriate investigative bodies IAW AFI 91-204. 4.1.5.  It is the MTF Commander‘s responsibility (with advice from the Quality Services 
Manager,   SJA   or   in-house   MLC)   to   establish   local   operating   instructions   regarding sequestered medical records safekeeping policy  and procedure.  As a minimum, the records 
will be kept in a separate, locked location, with limited staff and patient access.  If the patient is  actively  being  seen  at  the MTF,  copy  the  original  record for the outpatient  records  room 
and annotate on the jacket ―Clinic Copy.‖  Create the ―Clinic Copy‖ in CHCS as a unique record type for tracking purposes in the Medical Records Tracking (MRT) module. 
4.1.6.  Place  a  cover  sheet  on  the  original  medical  record  stating  the  record  has  been sequestered.  Maintain a separate file on why the record has been sequestered,  and the date 
(or  occurrence  of  an  event)  when  the  record  should  be  reviewed  to  determine  the  need  for continued sequestering.   Place a charge out in appropriate records room  with statement that 
the  record  has  been  sequestered.    If  a  ―Clinic  Copy‖  is  made,  ensure  that  original documentation is forwarded to the sequestered file and a copy is placed in the ―Clinic Copy.‖ 
----------------Page (106) Break----------------
  108  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.1.7.  Coordinate  an  annual  review  of  sequestered  records  with  the  base  legal  office  to determine  whether  the  records  should  continue  to  be  sequestered.    In  addition,  ensure  that 
records  are  reviewed  prior  to  patient  relocation  to  see  if  sequestering  is  still  applicable.    If sequestering is still required, mail the outpatient records to the gaining MTF.  Include a cover 
letter stating the records are to be sequestered and an explanation of the circumstances.  The losing MTF will make a certified true copy of the record before mailing for cases identified 
earlier in this section.  Maintain the copy until the claim or litigation is resolved and the base legal office or AFLA/JACC concurs. 
4.2.  Laws and Provisions Affecting Disclosure of Medical Information. 4.2.1.  Medical  personnel  must  comply  with  the  Privacy  Act,  Freedom  of  Information  Act, 
HIPAA,  Genetic  Information  Nondiscrimination  Act,  law  protecting  the  confidentiality  of drug   and   alcohol   abuse   and   treatment   records,   and   Comprehensive   Alcohol   Abuse 
amendments.  Each of these laws must be complied with regarding maintenance, access and disclosure of information from health records and related documentation. 
4.2.2.  Privacy Act of 1974. (PL 93-579 and 5 U.S.C. § 552a). 4.2.2.1.  Medical  records  are  maintained  within  a  system  of  records  protected  by  the 
Privacy  Act.    Electronic  and  hard  copy  records  are  covered  by  the  system  notice ―Medical Record System‖ (F044 AF SG E),  which identifies the records, including 
secondary  files, as inpatient and outpatient records of care received in Air Force MTFs.  Automated   records   of   treatment   and   clinical   diagnostic   tests   provided   to   Service 
Members  on  an  inpatient/outpatient  basis  in  MTFs  and  in  civilian  medical  facilities  are covered  by  Automated  Medical/Dental  Record  System  (F044  AF  SG D).    Disclosure  to 
third parties is prohibited, except pursuant to the written authorization of the individual to whom the record pertains or in specified limited circumstances as outlined in the Privacy 
Act (as implemented by AFI 33-332), and the HIPAA Privacy Rule (as implemented by DoD 6025.18-R). 
4.2.2.2.  Refer to AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program, for guidance on the collection, safeguarding, use, maintenance, access, amendment and disclosure of information.  This 
AFI  explains  policy  on  access,  disclosure,  time  periods, denial  authority,  judicial sanctions, and accountability of disclosure. Refer to Chapter 3 for information regarding 
responding  to  requests  from  individuals  for  copies  of  their  personal  health  records submitted under the Privacy Act. 
4.2.2.3.  DD Form  2005,  Privacy  Act  Statement - Healthcare  Records,  eliminates  the need  for  a  separate  Privacy  Act  statement  for  each  medical,  dental  or  related  document 
requiring individual identifying information.  The DD Form 2005 is not a consent form.  It serves as evidence that, as prescribed by the Privacy Act, the individual was informed 
of the purpose and uses of the information collected and was advised of his/her rights and obligations with respect to supplying the data.  The patient‘s signature is not mandatory.  
When the Privacy Act statement is printed on the reverse of AF Form 560, Authorization and  Treatment  Statement,  or  on  the  record  folder,  do  not  use  the  DD  Form  2005.    The 
patient  does  not  need  to  sign  the  DD  Form  2005  even  though  there  is  a  space  for signature. 
----------------Page (107) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   109  
4.2.3.  ADAPT Records. ADAPT Program treatment information collected and maintained as a  part  of  ADAPT  treatment  or  aftercare  services  are  maintained  IAW  42  U.S.C.  §  290dd-2 
and AFI 33-332.  These records are protected from public disclosure and only released under the circumstances listed in 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2(b) and (c). 
4.2.4.  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA),  (PL  93-502  and  5  U.S.C.  §  552).    Information from  health  records is  not  released  if  such  disclosure  would  result  in a  clearly  unwarranted 
invasion  of  privacy.    See  DOD  5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act Program, for specific guidance and procedures related to FOIA. 
4.2.5.  Patient  Self-Determination  Act  (PL  101-508,  Sections  4206  and  4751).    The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) mandates that healthcare institutions inform patients of their 
rights, according to state law, to make decisions regarding their medical care.  This includes the  right  to  accept  or  refuse  treatment  and  the  right  to  prepare  advance  directives.    An 
―advance directive‖ is defined as a written instruction by the patient, in the form of what is commonly known as ―living will‖ or a durable power of attorney for healthcare, recognized 
under State law (some states require both) and related to the provision for such care when the patient is incapacitated. 
4.2.5.1.  Each  MTF  will  establish  and  maintain  written  policies  and  procedures  to implement patient‘s rights to make decisions concerning their medical care.  Ensure 
compliance with State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State) respecting advance directives. 
4.2.5.2.  Provide  to  all  adult  patients  written  information  on  their  rights  under  the  host State‘s  law  to  make  decisions  concerning  their  medical  care,  including  the  right  to 
execute an advance directive. 4.2.5.3.  Document   whether   or   not   each   patient   has   an   advance   directive.      This 
information shall be documented on the AF Form 560 for inpatient care or the DD Form 2766,  Adult  Preventive  and  Chronic  Care  Flowsheet  for  outpatient  care,  and  on  the 
automated  cover  sheet  for  ambulatory  procedure  visit  (APV)  cases.   Note:  Utilize  the DD  Form  2766  and/or  DD  Form  2882,  Pediatric  and  Adolescent  Preventative  and 
Chronic  Flowsheet  for  all  new  records.    See  Chapter  5,  Health  Records  Management, paragraph   5.12.5.   for   more   information   regarding   this   form.   Provider   teams   are 
encouraged  to  ensure  adequate  free  texting  occurs  within  AHLTA  or  Essentris  notes  to document whether or not each patient has an advance directive, however, the hard copy 
documentation shall remain available. 4.2.5.4.  Provide for education of the staff and community on issues concerning advance 
directives. 4.2.5.5.  Check  with  your  local  SJA  and/or  Medical  Law  Consultant  (MLC)  for  further 
guidelines. 4.2.5.6.  Title  10  U.S.C.  §  1044c.  Advance  medical  directives  of  members  and  family 
members:  Includes  an  important  safeguard  for  military  members  and  their  family members  entitled  to  legal  assistance.    This  law  creates  ―military  advance  medical 
directives‖  that  are  exempt  from  any  requirements  of  form,  substance,  formality  or recording  required  by  State  law.    For  example,  if  an  Air  Force  member  has  a  military 
―Living Will‖ prepared in Florida, but then  becomes  severely  injured  in  California,  the 
----------------Page (108) Break----------------
  110  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
military Living Will is honored in California even though the document may not conform to California Law. 
4.2.6.  Provisions  Regarding  the  Release  of  Mental  Health  Information:    Mental  health information will be released IAW AFI 33-332, AFI 44-172, Mental Health, AFI 44-109 and 
DoD 6025.18-R.  See these directives for additional information. 4.2.7.  Restricted Reporting Guidance for Medical Personnel. 
4.2.7.1.  Some   states   require   medical   providers   to   report   to   civilian   authorities   in situations addressed by the DoD restricted-reporting policies.  Mandatory reporting laws 
for domestic abuse require medical providers to adhere to state reporting requirements for domestic  abuse/violence  and  sexual  assault  based  on  the  state  where  they  are  currently 
providing care and not their state of licensure.  To verify specific reporting requirements in  the  state  where  care  is  being  provided,  consult  your  local  SJA  or  in-house  MLC.  
Report   incidents   of sexual   assault   to   the   installation   Sexual   Assault   Response Coordinator  (SARC).    Report  domestic  abuse  to  Family  Advocacy  Officer  (FAO)  who 
will ensure an immediate assessment of the victim‘s safety, determine eligibility for Domestic   Violence   Restricted   Reporting,   and   coordinate   victim   advocacy   services 
through the Family Advocacy Program. Follow restricted reporting guidance provided in DoDI 6495.02 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures and AFI 36-
6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program. 4.2.7.2.  Medical record documentation under restricted reporting must contain sufficient 
information  to  allow  for  continuity  of  care  and  coding.  The  following  wording  in  bold type  should  be  placed  at  the  top  of  each  notation in  the  electronic  (AHLTA)  or  paper 
record: ―Restricted from disclosure unless and until determined to be releasable by the MTF Commander or designee.  Do not release without specific patient authorization or as 
specifically  authorized  by  DoD  or  AF  policy.‖  Electronic records in AHLTA may also be secured via a ―break the glass‖ function with the above notation in place.  This 
highlights  those  entries  as  restricted  and  prompts  additional  review  prior  to  release  or electronic review. 
4.3.  General Guidelines on Releasing Medical Information. 4.3.1.  Information  may  only  be  released  from  health  records  according  to  the requirements 
of   this   chapter,   and   as   permitted   under   other   applicable   laws   and   DOD   6025.18-R.  Information  released  will  be  limited  to  the  minimum  necessary  to  accomplish  the  intended 
purpose  of  the  disclosure,  to  an  identified  requester,  and  in  support  a  valid  requirement  for the information. 
4.3.2.  MTFs must develop policies and procedures for reviewing and responding to requests for access to PHI in accordance with the requirements described in DoD 6025.18-R, C8.2.4. 
4.3.3.  Original  medical  documents  or  records  are  not  released  to  any  person  or  agency outside the Executive Branch, except in compliance with a valid court order or as otherwise 
required  by  law.    Always  consult  the  SJA  or  in-house  MLC  prior  to  releasing  medical information under these circumstances. 
4.3.4.  Health records may contain information from non-military sources.  A patient can be referred  to  a  non-military  source  for  ancillary  and/or  diagnostic  care,  and/or  treatment.  
----------------Page (109) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   111  
Documentation  from  the  non-military  source  that  supports  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  will be filed in the patient‘s outpatient medical record.  This documentation will  then become a 
part of the patient‘s medical record and subsequent releases of information from the patient‘s record will include this information from non-military sources. 
4.3.5.  When   required,   obtain   written   authorization   from   the   patient   or his/her   legal representative before  releasing  information  from  the health  record  to  any  person or  agency.   
The DD Form 2870, Authorization for Disclosure of Medical or Dental Information, should be used for this purpose. 
4.3.5.1.  HIPAA  applies  to  the  release  of  PHI  for  living  and  deceased  patients.    For deceased  persons,  if  there  is  a  need  for  an  authorization  before  releasing  PHI,  the 
decedent's  legal  personal  representative  signs  written  authorization.    The  status  of Personal Representative is normally determined by the laws of the jurisdiction where the 
records  are  held.    Consult  with  local  SJA  or  MLC  to  determine  the  requirements  for personal representatives. 
4.3.5.2.  Unless state law affords the minor the opportunity to be considered an adult and gives  the  minor  greater  privacy  protections,  for  un-emancipated  minors,  physically  or 
mentally  challenged  persons,  a  parent  or  guardian  signs  the  written  authorization  and furnishes  a  copy  of  the  court  order  appointing  guardianship,  if  applicable,  with  the 
request.  Consult with the SJA or in-house MLC if there are questions. 4.3.5.2.1.  It is important to coordinate with the MLC and/or SJA on all cases where 
State  Law  provides  unique  provisions  for  emancipated  minors.    MTFs  should coordinate  with  their  MLC  to  identify  specific  State  requirements  and  incorporate 
these  requirements  into  MTF  policies  and  procedures  for  the  treatment  of  minors.  Examples of these issues include birth control, abortion, STD treatment, etc. 
4.3.5.3.  If litigation is pending or contemplated,  send the request for release to the SJA or in-house MLC for advice and appropriate action in accordance with AFI 51-301, Civil 
Litigation. 4.3.6.  General rules and individual state laws specify when a power of attorney is required.  
Refer any questions about power of attorney to the SJA or in-house MLC. 4.3.7.  File all correspondence, e.g., requests for PHI from the patient‘s health insurance 
company, state worker‘s compensation agency, or federal and state disability agencies, with an attached information release statement regarding the release of information in Section III 
of  the  health  record  for  permanent  safekeeping.    Refer  to  paragraph  4.5.2.  for  special instructions regarding  release to Department of Defense (DoD) Investigative Agencies. The 
Release of Information Office will keep a copy of all investigative agency requests. Note: Do not file federal investigative agency requests in the patient‘s medical record. 
4.3.8.  Fees  for  copying,  certifying  and  searching  health  records  are  listed  in  AFI  33-332.  Refer  to  Chapter  3  of  AFI  33-332  for  information  regarding  responding  to  requests  from 
individuals for copies of their personal health records. 4.3.9.  Advance  payments  for  information  requests  from  insurance  companies  and  other 
agencies may be accepted.  If the request is for a large volume or requires extensive research, notify the requester of any additional charges. 
----------------Page (110) Break----------------
  112  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.3.9.1.  If the payment is incorrect, inform the requesting agency that the information is being provided even though the required fee (specify amount) has not been paid, to avoid 
possible adverse effect to the patient.  Advise the requester to send payment promptly to the  Medical  Service  Account  (MSA)  office  by  check  or  money  order  payable  to  the 
Treasurer of the United States. 4.3.9.2.  Send  payment  to  the  MSA  office  with  the  completed  copy  of  the  transmittal 
letter  (see  paragraph  4.4.1.)  if  correct  payment  is  received  with  the  request.    If  the information  cannot  be  obtained  on  the  day  the  request  is  received,  complete  only  the 
required  items  and  send  the  form  and  payment  to  the  MSA  office  before  the  ordinary close of business each day. 
4.3.10.  Records   of   Newborns   Released   for   Adoption: Take   special   care   releasing information from the records of newborns who have been released for adoption.  Delete  all 
references to the child‘s natural parents. Stamp or identify the newborn inpatient record with the  following  statement,  ―Release  of  Information  Restricted  according  to  AFI  41-210, 
Chapter 4, section 4.3.‖  Do not forward AF Form 560, AF Form 565, Record of Inpatient Treatment,  SF  502,  Medical  Record - Narrative  Summary  (Clinical  Resume),  or  SF  535, 
Medical Record - Newborn included in the outpatient record. 4.3.11.  Restrictions  on  Information:  According  to  HIPAA  and  the  MHS  Notice  of  Privacy 
Practices (NoPP), a patient has the right to request restrictions of uses and disclosures of their medical  or  dental  information.    The  MTF  is  not  required  to  agree  to  the  restriction.    The 
restriction should be denied if the MTF could not reasonably accommodate the request, or if the request conflicts with this instruction or any other applicable DoD or Air Force directive.  
See DoD 6025.18-R for more information. 4.3.11.1.  Requests  for  restrictions  must  be  made  in  writing  using  DD  Form  2871, 
Request to Restrict Medical and Dental Information.  The MTF Commander, or designee, must respond to information restriction requests as soon as practicable. 
4.3.11.2.  If granted, the patient should be informed that the restriction is not permanent, and  only  applies  to  the  individual  or  MTF  that  grants  the  request.    The  restriction  can 
later  be  rescinded  (upon  written  notice  to  the  patient)  if complying  with  the  restriction becomes  too  cumbersome.    The  restriction  may  be  waived  in  emergency  situations  to 
save life or limb. 4.4.  Releasing Information and Patient Authorization. 
4.4.1.  Insurance  Agencies,  Worker's  Compensation and  Other  Third  Parties:  Third  party authorization forms can be used if they meet the criteria and include the required statements 
as  outlined  in  DoD  6025.18-R  to  include  the  name  or  organization  authorized  to  make  the disclosure (the MTF), the name or organization to whom the MTF is making the disclosure 
(the third party), the purpose of the disclosure, an expiration date or an expiration event, the signature of the individual, and signature date.  If a personal representative of the individual 
signs  the  authorization,  a  description  of  such  representative's  authority  to  act  for  the individual shall also be provided. Otherwise, authorizations are invalid under DoD 6025.18-
R.    If  prepayment  has  not  been  received,  then  use  a  locally  developed  form  to  identify the fees.  Prepare the form in three copies; send the original to the requester, file the second copy 
in  part  3  of  the  health  record  with  the  patient's  signed  authorization  for  release  of 
----------------Page (111) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   113  
information, and forward the third copy to the Resource Management Office.  Send a copy of the  form  to  the  local  SJA  when  answering  requests  for  information  on  injury  cases  that 
appear to involve medical affirmative claims action. 4.4.1.1.  Any requests identified as a potential third party liability case must be recorded 
on an AF Form 1488, Daily Log of Patients Treated for Injuries.  This includes requests received  from  an  attorney,  worker‘s  compensation  appeals  board,  or  an  insurance 
company  in  a  case  involving  work-related  injury  or  disease.    Forward  these  requests  to the  clinic  where  the  patient  was  seen.  The  clinic  will  complete  the  AF  Form  1488  and 
forward the AF Form 1488 to the Resource Management Office. 4.4.2.  Patient  or  Authorized  Representative:    Information  may  be  released  directly  to  the 
patient  or  to  a  representative  they  designate  in  writing.    An  abstract  of  a  patient's  relevant medical history (or copies of pertinent pages of the record) may be furnished to the patient, 
or authorized representative, when the patient departs on a temporary absence from home and requires medical care while away.  While DoD  6025.18-R, Chapter 11, provides conditions 
upon  which  a  covered  entity  may  deny  an  individual  access  to  their  PHI,  since  medical records  are  contained  in  Privacy  Act  systems  of  records,  access  is  generally  required  under 
the  Privacy  Act.    Consult  with  your  servicing  SJA  prior  to  denying  an  individual  access  to their own medical records. 
4.4.2.1.  If  a  provider  determines  that  direct  disclosure  to  the  patient  could  have  an adverse effect on either the physical or mental health, safety, or welfare of the individual, 
or  other  persons  with  whom  he/she  may  have  contact,  the  disclosure  will  be  made  to  a healthcare provider named by the individual, or to a person qualified to make psychiatric 
or mental determinations.  See DoD 5400.11-R, para. C3.1.6. for additional guidance. 4.4.2.2.  Provide  patients  or  their  designated  representatives‘  access  to  their  health 
records  upon  written  request.    The  original  record  is  always  retained  at  the MTF,  but copies  will  be  provided  if  requested.  Copy  requests  should  be  processed  within  20 
working days from the initial receipt of a written request preferably using the DD Form 2870.   If, however, the requested medical record  copies cannot be  provided, contact the 
requestor in writing and inform them of the delay.  Copy requests not completed by the 30th  calendar  day  will  be  elevated  to  the  MTF  Commander  for  immediate  explanation 
and resolution. 4.4.2.2.1.  Military healthcare providers are encouraged to discuss, with their patients, 
the contents of their patients‘ health records at least once a year.  Providers should encourage their patients  to review the healthcare  information stored in their medical 
record to ensure all necessary documents are included in the record, including referral results from civilian network providers.  Healthcare providers may recommend ways 
of  disclosing  health  records  other  than  by  direct  patient  access.    On  occasion,  a healthcare  provider  may  elect  to  disclose  information  on  specific  diagnoses  of 
terminal illness or psychiatric conditions to a patient‘s designated representative, and not directly to the patient, with the patient‘s concurrence. 
4.4.3.  Providing Medical Information or Patient Status Information to the Public (Including News  Media):    Disclosure  of  medical  information  to  the  public  is  extremely  limited  under 
both HIPAA and the Privacy Act.  If requested by a news media agency or upon receiving a general  public  inquiry,  the  Privacy  Act  only  permits the  release  information  that  does  not 
----------------Page (112) Break----------------
  114  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
constitute an invasion of personal privacy. HIPAA further restricts the disclosure of protected health information.  If appropriate, notify the next of kin before  releasing information to the 
news  media  or  to  the  public.    Contact  the  MTF  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  before  releasing information regarding a patient‘s status.  Never release a patient‘s diagnosis or prognosis 
without patient consent.  If the HIPAA Privacy Officer is not available, consult the SJA or in-house MLC prior to disclosing or providing any  medical or patient status information.  The 
releasing authority should check with the local HIPAA Privacy Officer to avoid unauthorized disclosures of patient information, especially those who have ―opted out‖ of the hospital 
directory. 4.4.3.1.  If  the  patient  has  been  given  the  opportunity  to  agree  or  object  to  being  in  the 
patient  directory,  and  has  not  objected,  the  following  information  may  be  released  to those  who  ask  for  the  individual  by  name:    Individual‘s location in the facility; the 
patient‘s  condition  described  in  general  terms  that  does  not  communicate  specific medical  information  about  the  individual  (using  descriptions  such  as:  stable,  good,  fair, 
serious,   critical,   conscious,   semiconscious,   and   unconscious);  and  the  individual‘s religious affiliation for use only by clergy. 
4.4.3.2.  The following information CANNOT be released without the patient‘s specific authorization:  marital status (e.g., divorced, single, widowed), base, installation, station 
or organization of routinely deployable or sensitive units, description of disease or injury, general factual circumstances, and general extent of the injury or disease.  Do not specify 
location or description that may prove embarrassing to the individual or reflect bad taste. 4.4.3.3.  Do  not  release  information  listed  in  paragraph  4.4.3.2.  if  the  patient  is  not 
conscious  or  is  mentally  incompetent.    If  the  patient  is  under  age  or  incompetent,  the guardian, or legal representative may make the decision. 
4.4.3.4.  More specific medical information may be provided by the healthcare provider if approved by the patient, guardian or legal representative. 
4.4.3.5.  NEVER  release  a  prognosis  or  sensitive  medical  information  relating  to  the admission of the patient, such as sexual assault, criminal actions, drug or alcohol abuse, 
psychiatric   or   social   conditions,   venereal   disease,   or   Acquired   Immunodeficiency Syndrome  (AIDS) – HIV  (Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus)  data  or  AIDS  related 
syndrome.   Note:  In  all  cases  in  paragraphs  4.4.3.3.  and  4.4.3.4.,  make  the  statement ―Further details with regard to (individual‘s) admission to the hospital are not releasable 
at this time.‖ 4.4.3.6.  Consult  the  SJA  or  in-house  MLC  for  assistance  with  problems  relating  to  the 
release of information. 4.5.  Disclosing or Releasing Information Not Requiring Patient Authorization. 
4.5.1.  Most disclosures made that are not for treatment, payment or healthcare operations, or pursuant to the patient‘s authorization must be tracked in the Protected Health Information 
Management  Tool  (PHIMT)  or  other  tracking  tool  approved  for  that  MTF.    Record  of disclosures will be maintained for six years.  Note:  There are instances when PHI disclosure 
is allowed without the patient‘s authorization.  Refer to DoD 6025.18-R  and  Section  4.2. Laws   and   Provisions   Affecting   Disclosure   of   Medical   Information,   paragraph   6.6.,

4.5.2.  DoD Investigative Agencies: Special agents are granted access to health records when proper  identification  is  provided  and  the  request  conforms  with  the  requirements  of  DoD 
6025.18-R.  The agent must sign a dated statement which contains the identity of the record to be examined, the identity (file number) of the investigation for which the record is being 
examined, and a certification by the examiner that the examination is required as part of the official  investigation.    Obtain  a  signed  receipt  for  any  material  or  document/record  copies 
(copied  by  the  agent  or  by  MTF  staff)  furnished  to  the  agent.    (Note: Do  not  file  the statement or document receipt in the patient‘s health record.  Maintain the statement in a 
separate folder in the general correspondence file until the investigation is concluded). 4.5.2.1.  Requests  must  be  specific  and  limited  in  scope  to  the  extent  reasonably 
practicable in light of the purpose for which the information is sought.  The MTF may not disclose  an  entire  medical  record,  except when  the  entire  medical  record  is  specifically 
justified  as  the  amount  that  is  reasonably  necessary  to  accomplish  the  purpose  of  the disclosure. 
4.5.2.2.  Investigative  agencies,  such  as  Air  Force  OSI  have  the  authority  to  request  a delay  in  disclosure  reporting.    The  individual‘s  right  to  receive  an  accounting  of 
disclosures  to  the  law  enforcement  may  be  temporarily  suspended  if  the  agency  or official indicates that such an accounting would impede the agency‘s activities.  Verbal 
requests for suspension shall not exceed 30 days; suspensions beyond 30  days  require  a written  request.  Account  for  the  disclosure  per  DoD  6025.18-R  if  no  request  for 
temporary suspension is made or upon the expiration of a temporary suspension. 4.5.3.  Litigation Cases:    Refer  requests  for  release  of  medical  information  required  for 
pending litigation to the SJA or in-house MLC for advice or action. 4.5.3.1.  When  mailing  medical  records  concerning  medical  malpractice  claims  use 
standard  First  Class  U.S.  mail  with  immediate  delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment, Certified  Mail,  or  other  commercially  available  option,  e.g.,  FedEx,  that  offers  package 
tracking  and/or  arrival  confirmation.  Use  of  standard  First  Class  U.S.  Postal  Service mailing  method  alone,  without  immediate  delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment  or 
Certified Mail receipt, is prohibited.  Return receipt confirmation must not be dependent upon the timeliness or willingness of the destination MTF to complete a DD Form 2825, 
Internal Receipt, or other manual delivery confirmation receipt option. 4.5.4.  Government  Departments  and  Non-DoD  Agencies:    Medical  information  is  released 
upon request, to the following Federal and State agencies or departments that have a proper and  legitimate  need  for the  information. Note: Some  requests  do  not  require  disclosure 
accounting.  See below. 4.5.4.1.  Release PHI to the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to process a claim in 
which the person‘s medical history is relevant or upon the separation or discharge of the individual  from  uniformed  service  for  the  purpose  of  a  determination  by  DVA  of  the 
individual‘s eligibility for, or entitlement to, benefits.  If the patient has not authorized the release of information to DVA, account for the disclosure. 
4.5.4.2.  Release  PHI  to  Federal  and  State  hospitals  and  prisons  for  further  medical treatment  of  a  person  in  their  custody.    Give  the  First  Sergeant  or  prisoner  escort  the 
original health records of active duty members, in a sealed envelope, when processing a 
----------------Page (114) Break----------------

patient to go to a corrections facility.  Disclosures under this paragraph do not need to be tracked. 
4.5.4.3.  Release  PHI  to  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  to  help detect,  treat,  and  prevent  occupational  injuries  and  diseases.    If  the  patient  has  not 
authorized the release of their information, account for the disclosure. 4.5.4.4.  If the patient is a Reservist or Guardsman, release PHI to Air Force Reserve or 
Air National Guard medical personnel when required to determine the member‘s medical qualification for continued military duty. 
4.5.4.5.  Release  the  PHI  of  foreign  military  personnel  to  their  appropriate  foreign military authority using the same guidelines as outlined in Chapter 6. 
4.5.4.6.  Law Enforcement Agency Inquires: Upon approval of the MTF Commander and with SJA or MLC concurrence, provide requested or subpoenaed PHI to law enforcement 
agencies  conducting  official  investigations.    Provide  either  supervised  access  to  health record(s)  or  certified  copies  only.    Requests  must  be  in  writing,  specific  and  limited  in 
scope  to  the  extent  reasonably  practicable  in  light  of  the  purpose  for  which  the information  is  sought.    If  the  patient  has  not  authorized  the  release  of  information  to 
respective law enforcement agency, account for the disclosure. 4.5.5.  RESEARCH PURPOSES: Follow the procedures in DoD 6025.18-R for releasing PHI 
for  research  that  involves  minimal  risk;  such  disclosures  would  need  to  be  tracked  in  the MTF‘s disclosure tracking system.  Otherwise, the release would need to be made pursuant to 
an  authorization  signed  by  the  patient  or  representative.  Alternatively,  MTFs  can  release information that is de-identified, without the patient‘s authorization and without tracking the 
disclosure. 4.6.  Electronic  Transmission  of  Protected  Health  Information  (ePHI).  All  electronic  PHI 
(ePHI) will be protected appropriately using administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. 4.6.1.  Any question regarding electronic transmission of ePHI will be directed to the HIPAA 
Security Officer. 4.6.1.1.  Previously  listed  guidelines  pertaining  to  the  release  of  information  apply 
regardless of the method of release. 4.6.1.2.  To protect patient privacy, only use fax transmission when the original record or 
mail-delivered  copies  will  not  meet  requirements  for  immediate  patient  care.    Only  fax sensitive information when urgently needed for patient care or when required by a third-
party  payer  for  ongoing  certification  of  payment  for  a  hospitalized  patient.    Do  not transmit   information   over   unsecured   telecommunications   systems.      Official   DoD 
telecommunications systems are subject to monitoring.  Using DoD telecommunications systems constitutes consent to monitoring. 
4.6.1.3.  Limit  fax  transmission  to  only  that  documentation  necessary  to  meet  the requester‘s needs.  Utilize regular mail or messenger service for routine disclosure of 
information to insurance companies, attorneys or other legitimate users. 4.6.1.4.  The cover letter sent with the documentation transmitted will include: 
4.6.1.4.1.  Information instructing the receiver to verify receipt of the fax. 
----------------Page (115) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   117  
4.6.1.4.2.  Date and time of fax transmission. 4.6.1.4.3.  Sending facility‘s name, address, telephone and fax numbers.

RECIPIENTS     ARE     HEREBY     NOTIFIED     THAT     INADVERTENT     OR UNAUTHORIZED  RECEIPT  DOES  NOT  WAIVE  SUCH  PRIVILEGE,  AND 
THAT UNAUTHORIZED DISSEMINATION, DISTRIBUTION, OR COPYING OF THIS  COMMUNICATION  IS PROHIBITED.  IF  YOU  HAVE  RECEIVED  THIS 
FAX  IN  ERROR,  PLEASE  DESTROY  THE  ATTACHED  DOCUMENT(S)  AND NOTIFY  THE  SENDER  OF  THE  ERROR  BY  CALLING....‖    (Document  the 
telephone number of the applicable MTF Privacy Office). 4.6.1.5.  If  the  disclosure  requires  accounting,  maintain  the  signed  release  authorization 
and  the  original  cover  letter  with  a  notation  of  the  disclosed  information,  date,  and identity of the employee making the disclosure.  File these in the patient‘s health record. 
4.6.1.6.  If the documentation is received by anyone other than the intended recipient, the burden is on the sender to remedy the error.  Frequently used destination numbers should 
be preprogrammed into the fax machine to eliminate misdial errors. 4.6.1.7.  If  the transmission does not reach the intended recipient‘s system, check the 
internal  logging  system  of  the  facsimile  machine  to  determine  where  the  transmission was  sent.    Send  a  request  to  the  incorrect  number  explaining  that  the  information  was 
misdirected and asking for return of the documents via mail.  Notify the HIPAA Privacy Officer and follow their instructions for any other action to take. 
4.6.1.8.  If the receiver of the documentation  is  a  Covered  Entity,  they  are  bound  by  all the laws and requirements governing the use and release of medical documentation. 
4.6.1.9.  To  help  protect  confidentiality,  establish  specific  policies  and  procedures  for handling documents received via facsimile.  Include the following minimum rules: 
4.6.1.9.1.  All  fax  machines  used  to  transmit  and  receive  PHI  must  be  located  in  a secure or supervised location. 
4.6.1.9.2.  Remove documents as soon as the transmission completes. 4.6.1.9.3.  Count pages to ensure transmission of all intended information.  Check for 
legibility and notify sender of problems. 4.6.1.9.4.  Read the cover letter and comply with instructions for verifying receipt.

4.6.1.11.  The use of a fax machine to transmit physician‘s orders is permissible.  To verify their authenticity, the provider should sign the orders prior to transmission.  If the 
orders were not signed, do not carry them out until the ordering physician verifies them.  Unless otherwise required by state law or regulation, the facsimile copy does not require 
countersignature. 4.6.1.12.  Documentation  transmitted  on  thermal  paper  will  fade  over  time.    If  a  fax 
machine uses thermal paper, make a photocopy of the document and place the copy in the record.  Destroy the thermal paper document after making the photocopy. 
4.6.2.  Tele-Health.  A  subset  of  e-Health,  Tele-health  is  the  use  of  electronic  applications, systems,   media,   clinical information   management,   and   encrypted   telecommunications 
technologies to provide or support clinical healthcare, patient and professional health-related education, public health, and health administration when distance separates the participants.  
Tele-health embraces several innovative and exciting aspects of modern healthcare including, secure messaging between provider and patient, virtual patient e-health record access, on-line 
patient  appointment  booking,  professional  diagnostic  imaging  and  remote  surgical/specialty consulting capabilities, to name just a few. 
4.6.2.1.  Secure messaging between a provider and patient  generally  requires the patient to access a government sponsored internet website where once a patient‘s identity has 
been  validated,  the  patient  then  has  access  to  an  internal  website  messaging  account  to use when corresponding with his or her healthcare team.  E-mail correspondence between 
a patient  and provider, where the patient‘s medical condition, situation, or personal medical information  is  discussed,  is  not  allowed  using  personal  e-mail  accounts.    The 
Corporate  Dental  Application  (CDA),  MiCare  secure  messaging,  and  any  other  AFMS approved  secure  messaging  programs  are  authorized.  Clinical  e-mail  between  MTF 
personnel and beneficiaries is not authorized at this time.  Refer to Section 6I, Use of e-Mail to communicate PHI for additional information regarding this subject. 
4.6.2.2.  Clinical  Professional  Consultation:  When  telemedicine  is  applied  to  conduct  a real-time  professional  office  visit  or  consultation  between  providers  where  the  e-mail 
message is encrypted and the conversation occurs between two ―.mil‖ e-mail  accounts, the event must be fully documented in the patient‘s medical record by either or both 
healthcare providers. 4.6.3.  Clinical  Use  of  Electronic  Mail  in  Provider  to  Provider  or  Provider  to  Patient 
Communications.  Refer to Chapter 6 for guidelines on the use of e-mail to transmit PHI. 4.7.  Personal   Health   Record   Copy   Requests.  (Authority   DoD   6025.18-R,   DoD   Health 
Information Privacy Regulation, Chapter 11).  This section includes copies produced from paper-based and electronic-based medical records. 
4.7.1.  Urgent  copy  requests  for  referral  appointments:  If  a  patient  requests to  remove  the medical record from the medical facility, MTF personnel are required to inform the patient of 
----------------Page (117) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   119  
the  DoD  policy  prohibiting  patients  from  hand-carrying  their  record(s).    Primary  care managers  and/or  referring  MTF  providers  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  a  patient  has 
copies  of  any  necessary  paperwork  from  the  outpatient,  inpatient,  dental  or  other  paper  or electronic health record required to ensure adequate medical reference and continuity of care 
between  the  MTF  and  the  external  provider  or civilian  medical  facility.    These  copies  are provided free of charge.  There may, however, be instances when a patient has not obtained 
the necessary  documents  for  the  referral  visit  for  an  external  MTF  patient  appointment.    In these  cases,  copy  the  pertinent  section/document(s)  and  provide  the  copy  to  the  patient.  
Requests  of  this  type  must  be  expedited  so  the  patient  can  provide  this  information  to  the referral provider at the time of the appointment.  Unless specifically requested by either the 
referring or accepting physician, do not copy the entire medical or dental record.  Copies of pertinent  medical  documents  may  also  be  faxed  or  mailed  from  the  MTF  to  the  receiving 
provider  or  civilian  medical  facility  provided  the  necessary  coordination  with  the external provider has been accomplished. 
4.7.2.  Urgent copy requests to meet short-notice or ―no-notice‖ Service Member separations or discharges  resulting  from accelerated Force Management related personnel action: When 
informed or notified by an appropriate service separation or discharge authority of a Service Member‘s request to obtain a complete copy of his or her Service Treatment Record (STR) to 
meet expedited Force Management related separation or discharge installation out-processing requirements, MTF records copy personnel will immediately prioritize the request above all 
other  non-urgent,  routine  requests.    The  Service  Member  is  required  to  complete  the necessary record copy request form at the MTF Release of Information office. 
4.7.3.  Non-Urgent,  Routine  Copy  Requests.  Refer  the  patient  to  the  appropriate  Release  of Information (ROI) office.  ROI personnel will inform the patient of the average MTF wait-
time  for  non-urgent  requests  and  should  use  the  most  current  DD  Form  2870.   Note: the timeline for such request are established in 4.4.2.2. The time duration may be based upon a 
variety  of  factors,  including,  but  not  limited  to  the  staffing,  the  size  of  the  individual record(s)  or  record  portion(s)  to  be  copied,  the  number  of  non-urgent  daily  and  weekly 
requests,  the  number  of  emergent  and/or  urgent  daily  and  weekly  requests  and  the  time  it takes  to  redact  SSNs.  The  staff  assigned  to  the  ROI  office  should  keep  their  supervisors 
appraised on any current or impending delays. Unforeseen delays can be documented by the leadership and affected beneficiaries should be notified. 
4.7.4.  When  the  medical  record  copy  request  is  complete,  provide  the  patient  with  his/her copies  at  no  charge.    Health  record  copies  may  be  provided  in  the  form  of  electronic  or 
digital  media  format  (e.g.,  compact  disc)  only  if  the  patient  agrees  to  accept  the  copied record(s) in this format.   Inform the Service Member the VA will not accept a digital copy or 
CD copy of the record if the patient‘s intent is  to  give  this  copy  to  the  VA  for  processing their claim. 
4.7.5.  Repeated  personal  requests  for  the  same  document  copies  or  repeated  requests  for partial  or  complete  volume  copies,  that  have  already  been  provided  to  the  patient  or  his 
representative,  within  the  same  12-month  period  may  result  in  a  financial  charge  to  the patient or his representative.  Upon local approval of the MTF Commander, the ROI function 
may  charge  beneficiaries  or  their  agents/representatives,  a  reasonable  fee  for  excessive and repeated requests for copies of medical records.  Record copying fees documented in AFI 33-
332, Air Force Privacy Program may be used to establish a baseline pricing schedule.  At no 
----------------Page (118) Break----------------
  120  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
time  will  any  patient  be  charged  more  than  $.15  cents  per  single-sided  paper  page.  Maximum charge will not exceed $75.00 for each personal paper-record request. 
4.7.6.  Radiographs or Radiographic Images or Film: Generally, only the provider‘s paper document radiographic ―interpretation‖ or analysis report is provided to requestor.  The cost 
of producing this paper report is usually free, unless repeated request for the same document are submitted (see above paragraph for excessive paper record copying charges).  Copies of 
actual  radiographs,  sometimes  referred  to as the, ―radiographic film, x-ray  film  or  x-ray images,‖ may be provided upon specific request. 
4.7.7.  All  provider  SSNs  must  be  redacted  from  the  health  record  before  issuing  a  copy.  This  mandate  applies  to  all  forms  of  health  records  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  the 
outpatient medical, dental treatment, inpatient, and extended ambulatory record).  This policy applies to copies provided for any purpose or request, including an individual‘s request for 
copies  of  his  or  her  own  health  records.   Original  medical  records  shall  remain  intact  and unaltered.  The original provider‘s SSN must never be deleted from the original health 
record.  Other SSNs should be redacted when warranted. 4.7.8.  Before  issuing  a  record  copy  (partial  or  full),  redact  all  sponsor  SSNs  from  every 
aspect of the health record, unless the copy request originates from the actual sponsor.  This mandate  applies  to  all  forms  of  health  records  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  outpatient 
medical, dental treatment, inpatient, and extended ambulatory record).  This policy applies to copies provided for any purpose or request.  Original medical records shall remain intact and 
unaltered.  The original sponsor SSN must never be deleted from the original health record.  Other SSNs should be redacted when warranted. 
4.7.9.  If an MTF chooses to provide health records electronically (e.g., scanned copy in lieu of  paper),  the  MTF  must  use  standardized  nomenclature  when  naming  the  file.    This  will 
allow outside agencies  and others, as applicable, to easily identify a beneficiary‘s treatment record.  At a minimum, the file name should contain the following:  the term ―Outpatient 
Record,‖  ―Dental  Record,‖  or  ―Inpatient  Record‖  (as  applicable),  last  name  of  the beneficiary,       and date       the       copy       was       made,       e.g.,       OUTPATIENT 
RECORD_[SMITH]_15MAR2010].pdf. 4.8.  Entering Into Agreements to Manage Health Record Copy Requests. 
4.8.1.  MTFs  are  authorized  to  establish  relationships  with  external  businesses  or  document copy service  providers  to  maximize  the  MTF  ROI  mission  and  decrease  copy  request  wait 
times.  Agreements should be coordinated with the HIPAA Privacy Officer, the TOPA Flight Commander, the Resource  Management  Flight  Commander, the Medical  Support  Squadron 
Commander,  the  MTF  Commander,  MLC  or  installation  SJA,  the  installation  contracting squadron,  and  the  installation  Plans  and  Program  office  or  equivalent  installation  function 
that oversees support agreements. 
Section 4B—Patient Registration & Multiple Healthcare Eligibility 
4.9.  Patient Registration. 4.9.1.  The Patient Administration function has direct oversight of MTF patient registration.  
MTF clinical work centers such as the pharmacy, laboratory, emergency department, and the local TRICARE Service Center require the ability to register patients in CHCS.  To ensure a 
----------------Page (119) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   121  
balanced  and  responsible  registration  process  throughout  the  MTF,  Patient  Administration personnel,  in  partnership  with  CHCS  System  Administrators  and  Information Management 
officials, will provide user training and are the only MTF approval authorities authorized to grant registration access and/or similar capabilities.  The practice of granting blanket CHCS 
registration access to all MTF staff members upon unit in-processing will cease.  Registration capabilities  will  only  be  granted  to  authorized  MTF  staff  members  who  have  demonstrated 
the correct registration procedures and have received documented patient registration training validated  by  the  MTF  TOPA  or  Patient  Administration  function  or  flight  commander.  
Requests  for  CHCS  registration  training  must  be  coordinated  and  approved  by  the  flight superintendent  or  flight  commander  before  submitting  requests  to  the  MTF  TOPA  Flight 
Commander,  Patient  Administration  Officer,  Systems  or  Information  Management  Flight Commander.    Training  requests  submitted  by  individual  users  seeking  CHCS  registration 
training, without documented flight level approval, will not be accepted. 4.9.2.  At MTF point of service locations, e.g., outpatient clinic reception or customer service 
front desk, laboratory front desk, radiology department reception desk, etc., only supervisors and  personnel  that  regularly  receive  patients  and  confirm  appointments  will  be  authorized 
CHCS  registration keys.  CHCS registration capabilities or the CHCS File Man code ―&‖ with  the  appropriate  CHCS  registration  related  security  keys  will  not  be  automatically 
granted or added to any MTF staff member‘s CHCS user profile without flight commander justification.    The  MTF TOPA  Flight  Commander, Patient  Administration  Officer, Systems 
Flight   Commander   and   /or   designated   Information   Management   Officer   have   shared approval   authority   to   grant   training   permission.      TOPA   officials   are   responsible   for 
conducting  periodic  reviews  of  all  MTF  personnel  with  CHCS  registration  capabilities  to verify training requirements have been met and registration capabilities remain valid. 
4.9.3.  When  registering  a  patient  for  the  first  time,  MTF  personnel  should  obtain  as  much information  as  possible  without  degrading  medical  care.    At  a  minimum,  the  following 
patient information must be captured: 4.9.3.1.  Patient's name (first, last & middle initial). 
4.9.3.2.  Sponsor‘s name. 4.9.3.3.  Sponsor‘s Social Security Number (SSN). 
4.9.3.4.  Patient's  relationship  code/Family  Member  Prefix  (FMP)  e.g.,  20-Sponsor,  30-Spouse, 01-Child, etc. 
4.9.3.5.  Patient  Category  (e.g.,  F11/Active  USAF,  A11/Active  US  Army,  F31/Retired USAF  Service  Member, M12/Marine  Corps  Reserve  Component  Member,  N41/Active 
Duty Navy Family Member, etc.). 4.9.3.6.  Patient's date of birth. 
4.9.3.7.  Patient's gender. 4.9.3.8.  Patient's Service (sponsor only). 
4.9.3.9.  Patient's station/unit (sponsor only). 4.9.3.10.  Patient's rank (sponsor only). 
4.9.3.11.  Patient‘s address & telephone contact information.

4.9.3.14.  MTF where medical record(s) are normally maintained. 4.9.3.15.  Marital Status (if Full Registration is used). 
4.9.3.16.  Race (if Full Registration is used). 4.9.3.17.  Ethnicity (if Full Registration is used). 
4.9.3.18.  Individual  Patient  SSN  or  available/authorized  unique  ―Person  or  Personal Identifier‖ (DoD ID Number, FIN, TIN, ITIN, etc.). 
4.9.3.18.1.  Person or Personal Identifiers.  Most patients treated in the AFMS possess Social  Security Numbers (SSN).  Individual identification using a person‘s unique 
Social  Security  Number  provides  a  solid  framework  from  which  to  build  a  personal eligibility  profile  in  DEERS  and  within  the  MTF.    SSNs  are  considered  Person  or 
Personal Identifiers and are used as the default numeric ―account number‖ for which CHCS  partly  bases  individual  identification.    Some  patients,  however,  may  not 
possess  a  SSN  for  various  reasons.    Frequently,  alternative  Person  or  Personal Identifiers are used to reduce the use of SSNs or identify patients as individuals who 
may  not  possess  a  SSN.    There  are  multiple  alternative  Person  Identifiers  issued, used, and/or created depending on the patient‘s particular situation. 
4.9.3.18.1.1.  In an effort to reduce the unnecessary use of SSNs, DoD has begun the  use  of  alternative  Personal  Identifiers  in  place  of  the  SSN.    The  alternative 
Personal  Identifiers include the DoD  Identification (ID) Number which uniquely identifies  individuals  and  the  DoD  Benefits  Number  that  identifies  individuals 
eligible  to  receive  DoD  benefits  such  as  commissary,  exchange,  and  TRICARE benefits. 
4.9.3.18.1.1.1.  The  Military  Health  System,  when  feasible,  will  limit  the use and  display  of  SSNs  while  migrating  systems  and  business  processes  to  use 
the DoD ID Number.  Refer to the MHS Interim SSN Reduction Plan, 17 Oct 2011 for more SSN reduction information. 
4.9.3.18.1.2.  Foreign  Identification  Numbers  (FIN)  are  issued  to  foreigners  who are  eligible  for  healthcare  but  who  are  not eligible  to  obtain  a  SSN.    The  FIN 
takes the place of a SSN.  The FIN begins with the number ―9,‖ e.g., 9XX-XX-XXXX and is issued by DEERS.  An example of someone who may be issued a 
FIN:  A  military  service  member  from  a  participating  SOFA  country  here  in the United States enrolled in a pilot training program. 
4.9.3.18.1.3.  The Temporary Identification Number (TIN) is an ID number issued by DEERS to patients who are eligible for SSNs but who either do not possess an 
issued SSN or those who have been issued a SSN but have not reported the SSN to DEERS.  The TIN takes the place of a SSN.  The TIN begins with the number 
―8,‖  e.g.,  8XX-XX-XXXX.    The  TIN  resembles  a  ―Pseudo‖  SSN  which  is generated only in CHCS.  Although the TIN begins with the number ―8‖ it is 
different from the ―Pseudo‖ SSN.  A TIN should appear on the beneficiaries ID card and remain constant between different CHCS computer server hosts.  Pseudo 
----------------Page (121) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   123  
SSNs are only relevant or applicable to the local CHCS host computer server (at the  MTF  where the number was created) and are based on the patient‘s date of 
birth  or  date  of  emergency  medical  treatment  when  a  Patient  Identifier  is  not known.  Patients can legitimately have different Pseudo SSNs on different CHCS 
host computer servers. 4.9.3.18.1.4.  According  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS),  the  definition  of 
an  Individual  Taxpayer  Identification  Number  (ITIN)  is,  ―A  tax  processing number  issued  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service.    It  is  a  nine-digit  number  that 
always begins with the number 9 and has a range of 70-88 in the fourth and fifth digit,  example  9XX-70-XXXX.    The  IRS  issues  ITINs  to  individuals  who  are 
required to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number but who do not have, and are not eligible to obtain a SSN from the Social Security Administration (SSA).‖ 
4.9.3.18.1.5.  Other alternative Personal Identifiers do exist but the three previous examples  are  the  most  common  forms  for  which  an  MTF  will  be  presented.  
When  using  these  Personal  Identifiers  during  patient  registration,  the  user  must insert  the  Person  Identifier  in  place  of  the  SSN.    Users  may  also  be  required  to 
add  the  Personal  Identifier  again  when  and  if  prompted  for  the  Person  ID  Type Code, e.g., ―F‖ for FIN, ―T‖ for TIN, and ―I‖ for ITIN, etc.  If the patient  is 
eligible  for  a  SSN  and  does  not  yet  posses  the  official  number,  encourage  the patient or sponsor to provide the SSN to the local DEERS office following SSN 
issuance  from  the  SSA.  The  new  SSN  will  replace  the  alternative  Personal Identifier in DEERS and CHCS. 
4.9.3.19.  Command   Security,   if   applicable,   e.g.,   PRP/PSP   (Personnel   Reliability Program/Presidential Support Program). 
4.9.3.20.  Active Flight Status (if patient is assigned to an active flight position).  This is a Full  Registration  demographic  question  and  minimal  Full  Registration  data  must  be 
available to properly complete the registration for this category of patient. 4.9.3.21.  Length of Service (Years). 
4.9.4.  Registration  Options.    All  MTF  staff  involved  in  Patient  Registration  or   who periodically  update  demographic  information  from  DEERS  during  eligibility  checks  must 
have the CHCS ―DG REG SYNCH‖ security key.  This will allow the user to update the patient‘s registration data from DEERS while synchronizing  the  patient  with  their  DEERS 
entry.  Synchronization prevents the patient‘s SPONSOR from being edited as well as key registration fields (to include patient SSN (if patient is SPONSOR) DOB, SEX, and NAME, 
etc.) within CHCS.  Seven types of patient registration mechanisms are available through the automated CHCS system.  The first two types of registration (FULL and MINI) are the types 
of ―manual‖ registration that are authorized for use. Both of these registration options involve a  DEERS  check/synchronization/population  of  the  Electronic  Data  Interchange  Person 
Number  (EDIPN),  also  known  as  the  DoD  ID  Number,  from  DEERS  to  CHCS  during  the registration process, which will prevent specific types of patient duplication while satisfying 
most    eligibility    concerns    between    DEERS    and    CHCS.        A    successful    DEERS check/synchronization is a critical part of patient registration (if the patient is known to exist 
in DEERS with or without eligibility).  Choosing the correct registration method depends on intent,   MINI   REGISTRATION   is   the   default   registration   within   CHCS   while   FULL 
----------------Page (122) Break----------------
  124  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
REGISTRATION  is  more  commonly  used  for  INPATIENT/ADMISSIONS  (every  MTF inpatient  admission  requires  FULL  REGISTRATION).    The  difference  between  these  two 
forms of registration is the amount of demographic data available for input as there are data fields within FULL REGISTRATION that are not available within MINI REGISTRATION 
(such  as  Next  of  Kin,  Emergency  Contact  Information,  Flying  Status,  etc.).    Each  MTF should  determine  which  registration type  best  fits  the  current  mission,  depending  on  the 
individual patient‘s needs.  In either case, the minimal required data should be collected to allow the registration to be completed correctly. 
4.9.5.  Another  form  of  patient  registration  is  Auto-Registration  via  initial  enrollment/PCM assignment  from  DEERS  through  PIT  (PCM  Information  Transfer).    Patients  are  normally 
registered automatically without incident, but an error (PIT ERROR) may occur during auto-registration     that     requires     manual     intervention     to     complete     and     correct     the 
registration/enrollment.    Other  registration-related  PIT  ERRORS  can  occur  that  affect  the patient appearing eligible within CHCS, or a change in eligibility can cause a PIT  error (as 
PIT  errors are resolved that result in a change of eligibility, the patient‘s hard copy records should be checked as this may cause a change in terminal digit that can affect the patient‘s 
records  jacket  and  where  the  record  is  filed;  this  rule  also  applies  to  any  registration  that changes sponsorship and physical records are present).  PIT errors should be resolved and the 
errors that caused them followed through each system.  File and Table PIT errors, which are related to the PCM should be forwarded to the PCM/Managed care department for resolution. 
4.9.6.  The following two types of registration are related to the lab functionality.  MAIL-IN REGISTRATION  is  used  by  the  lab  to  register  patients  when  printing  results  for  the 
requesting  location  (to  disseminate  the  results  by  fax  or  print  out  to  the  referring  or requesting location).  This type of registration does not involve a  DEERS check and  (if the 
patient is a dependent and the sponsor is not already registered on the system) automatically creates a false or ―fake‖ sponsor registration;  additionally,  a  PATCAT  is  not  present  or 
required.  For this reason, MAIL-IN REGISTRATION should not be used to add patients to the  CHCS  host  computer  server.    Instead,  FULL  or  MINI  REG  should  be  used.    After  the 
patient has been correctly added to the system, MAIL-IN REGISTRATION may be used to set the referring/requesting location for bulk printing of the results. 
4.9.7.  LAB INTEROPERABILITY REGISTRATION is a type of registration used by MTF laboratories  that  perform  laboratory  analysis  on specimens  collected  from  external  MTFs.  
These  MTFs  utilize  CHCS  operating  from  other  CHCS  host  computer  servers.    LAB INTEROPERABILITY  REGISTRATION  utilizes  the  LAB  MAIL-IN  functionality  to  add 
patients.    MTF  TOPA  flights  should  work  with  Clinical  Pathology  departments  through periodic reviews to ensure that patients are being added to the local CHCS host properly. 
4.9.8.  NON-HUMAN  REGISTRATION  is  a  type  of  registration  used  for  animals,  such  as military working dogs, that require ancillary services at the MTF.  It is important that animals 
requiring   ancillary   services   are   added   utilizing   the   NON-HUMAN   REGISTRATION function  and  not  MINI  or  FULL  registration  as  these  types  of  registration  require  data 
elements such as SSNs. 4.9.9.  CREATING MTF  MANUFACTURED  OR  ―PSEUDO‖  SOCIAL  SECURITY 
NUMBERS.  Manufactured or ―Pseudo‖ SSNs are created within CHCS when a patient‘s SSN  or  formal  Person/Personal  Identifier  is  not  known  or  available.    A  Pseudo  SSN  looks 
----------------Page (123) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   125  
like a standard SSN but the number sequence always begins with the number ―8,‖ e.g., 8XX-XX-XXXX.    A  Pseudo  SSN  is  automatically  generated  during  CHCS  registration  by 
inserting the letter ―P‖ into the SSN data entry field.  During John Doe registration, the Pseudo SSN is automatically generated based on the patient‘s date of birth.  The CHCS will 
sequentially  number  the  Pseudo  SSN  for  any  other  patients  registered  (on  the  local  CHCS host  computer  server)  who  also  received  a  Pseudo  SSN  with  the  same  date  of  birth.    For 
example, when trying to register a current patient with a date of birth of 21 March 1969, an MTF staffer discovers another patient was previously registered in the local CHCS host with 
a Pseudo SSN (with the same date of birth).  In this instance, the Pseudo SSN for the current patient would  look  like  this:  801-69-0321.    The  number  for  the  first  patient  to  receive  a 
Pseudo SSN with the same date of birth would look like this:  800-69-0321.  The first three digits  of  the  Pseudo  SSN  identify  the  patient  sequence  number.    The  second  two  digits 
identify the patient‘s year of birth.  The last four digits identify the patient‘s birth month and day.  Pseudo SSNs are ―placeholder‖ numbers only.  These temporary patient identification 
numbers  should  not  be  used  for  definitive  identification.    The Pseudo  SSN  for  a  particular patient registered at one MTF may not be the same number at another MTF outside the local 
CHCS host computer server.  When legitimate Person Identifiers (SSN, FIN, ITIN, and TIN) are  later  identified  or  become  available,  the  patient‘s registration profile must be updated 
with  the  correct  formal  Person  Identifier.    In  some  circumstances,  MTFs  may  feel  it  is necessary to create customized SSN identifiers to register and identify patients (not normally 
authorized  MHS  or  Direct  Care)  who  are  being  treated  or  offered  MTF  Direct  Care  in accordance  with  unique  community  healthcare  partnerships,  professional,  continuing,  or 
specific medical education programs, or other HQ USAF/SG approved healthcare eligibility extension   agreements   or   programs.      MTFs   are   required   to   obtain   permission   from 
AFMOA/SGAT prior to  initiating a  customized registration program whereby patient SSNs are manufactured or where Pseudo SSNs or similar SSN substitution process is expected on a 
reoccurring basis. 4.9.9.1.  Caution:    A  TIN  and  Pseudo  SSN  look  alike.    The  Pseudo  SSN  should  not  be 
confused with a TIN, which also begins with the number ―8.‖  A TIN is generated by DEERS  and  remains  constant  between  CHCS  computer  server  hosts  unlike  an  MTF 
manufactured SSN  or  Pseudo  SSN  that  only  applies  to  the  local  CHCS  host  computer server and/or MTF where the number was created. 
4.9.10.  CIVILIAN  EMERGENCY  or  ―JOHN  DOE‖  REGISTRATION  is  a  type  of registration  that  should  only  be  used  in  an  emergency.    The  creation  of  a  temporary 
manufactured SSN or ―Pseudo‖ SSN is authorized to complete the registration process in an emergency.    When  using  either  the  automated  CHCS  John  Doe  system  driven  options  or 
when using an MTF customized John Doe registration process tailored for a specific patient circumstance  (for  which  AFMOA/SGAT  has  approved),  this  registration  type  is  authorized 
when it is necessary to administer urgent healthcare and the patient‘s Person Identifier is not known or impossible to obtain.  Following initial emergency treatment, replace or correct the 
temporary   Pseudo   SSN   and   any   other   missing   or   manufactured   patient   demographic information entered during the John Doe registration process.  The patient‘s registration 
profile must be updated with the correct patient information or merged if another or second patient registration profile was created with the correct Person Identifier on the local CHCS 
computer  server  host.    If  possible,  the  Person  Identifier  may  need  to  be  corrected  in  each 
----------------Page (124) Break----------------
  126  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
affiliated  computer  application  or  system  affected  by  the  CHCS  John  Doe  registration, including AHLTA. 
4.9.10.1.  Use  the  John  Doe  or  Civilian  Emergency  registration  type  if  the  patient  does not  a)  possess  or  know  his  or  her  formal  Person  Identifier,  e.g.,  SSN,  TIN,  FIN,  ITIN, 
etc., b) is unconscious, or c) is not capable of providing his or her personal information.  In this scenario, let‘s assume today is 15 Dec 2010 and its 10:00 a.m.  An unknown, 
unconscious patient is transported to the MTF emergency department and is undergoing emergency   medical   care   necessary   to   save   his   life.      Personnel   from   the   Patient 
Administration   function,   Admissions   and   Dispositions   office,   or   the   Emergency Department  are  authorized  to  create  a  temporary  Pseudo  SSN  to  complete  the  patient‘s 
CHCS  registration.    During  the  John  Doe  or  Civilian Emergency  registration  process,  a Pseudo SSN is automatically generated by inserting the letter ―T‖ for Today or today‘s 
date  into  the  SSN  data  entry  field.    This  temporary  Person  Identifier  is  automatically generated based on the current or present date (today‘s date).  The CHCS will create a 
temporary patient Pseudo SSN that looks like this:  800-10-1215.  The first three digits of the Pseudo SSN identify the patient sequence number.  The ―800‖ represents  the  first 
person to be registered into the local CHCS host computer server on any particular day.  The second two digits identify the current year.  The last four digits identify today‘s date 
(present month and day).  The CHCS will sequentially number the Pseudo SSN for any other  patients  registered  (on  the  local  CHCS  host  computer  server)  who  may  also  have 
received a Pseudo SSN with today‘s date.  Let‘s further assume that later in the evening at 2030hrs on the same day, 15 Dec 2010 an infant girl is born upstairs in the Labor and 
Delivery  department.    Since  babies  are  born  without  pre-issued  SSNs  or  other  formal Person  Identifiers,  the  use  of  a  Pseudo  SSN  would  also  be  necessary  to  complete  the 
registration  process  for  the  new  baby  girl.    Using  the ―T‖  automated  date  creation mechanism  in  the  SSN  data  entry  field,  her  Pseudo  SSN  would  look  like  this:  801-10-
1215.    The  only  difference  between  this  temporary  patient  Pseudo  SSN and  the Pseudo SSN  created  earlier  for  the  John  Doe  civilian  admission  patient  is  the  inclusion  of  the 
number ―1‖ in the first three digits of the Pseudo SSN.  Since this is the second person registered into the local CHCS host computer server on the same date, the last number in 
the first three-digit patient sequence number changes to ―1.‖  If a third infant or unknown person  (for  which  a  date  of  birth  could  not  be  obtained)  was  registered  into  the  local 
CHCS  host  on  the  same  day,  the  last  number  in  the  first  three-digit  patient  sequence number would change to ―802‖ or 802-10-1215. 
4.9.10.2.  Pseudo  SSNs  are  ―placeholder‖  numbers  only.    These  temporary  patient identification numbers should not be used for definitive identification.  The Pseudo SSN 
for  a  particular  patient  registered  at  one  MTF  may  not  be  the  same  number  at another MTF outside the local CHCS host computer server.  When legitimate Person Identifiers 
(SSN, FIN, ITIN, and TIN) are identified or become available, the patient‘s registration profile must be updated with the correct formal Person Identifier. 
4.9.10.3.  The use of a temporary Pseudo SSN registration process (for patients for whom their  date  of  birth  information  can  be  obtained  as  well  as  those  patients  for  whom  this 
information  cannot  be  obtained)  is  authorized  and  may  be  repeated  many  times  when treating multiple patients received during a mass casualty incident. 
----------------Page (125) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   127  
4.9.11.  NEWBORN   INFANT   REGISTRATION.      Authorized   newborn   infant   family members  will  be  registered  under  their  sponsor‘s  SSN.    If  both  mother  and  father  are 
ADSMs,  the  parents must choose to which sponsor‘s SSN the infant will be affiliated or attached.  The sponsor affiliation may be changed if, at a time shortly following the child‘s 
birth, the parents register their infant with DEERS under the opposite sponsor‘s information used during the infant‘s birth. 
4.9.11.1.  The  Electronic  Health  Record  (EHR)  patient  registration  cannot  continue without the entry of the infant‘s own SSN.  A newborn infant, however, does not possess 
a SSN and is not issued a SSN or other Person Identifier at the time of birth.  The use or entry of a temporary Pseudo SSN to complete the registration process is authorized. 
4.9.11.2.  During the Newborn Infant registration process, a Pseudo SSN is automatically generated  by  inserting  the  letter ―T‖ for Today or today‘s date into the SSN data entry 
field.  The temporary Person Identifier is automatically generated based on the current or present date (today‘s date).  For this example, let‘s assume today is 15 Jan 2011.  Captain 
and Mrs. Smith‘s infant son was born at 0600hrs earlier today.  The CHCS will create a patient  Pseudo  SSN  that  looks  like  this:    800-11-0115.    The  first  three  digits  of  the 
Pseudo SSN identify the patient sequence number.  The ―800‖ represents the first baby or person to be registered into the local CHCS host computer server on any particular day.  
The second two digits identify the current year.  The last four digits identify today‘s date (present month and day).  The CHCS will sequentially number the Pseudo SSN for any 
other  patients  registered  (on  the  local  CHCS  host  computer  server)  who  may  also  have received a Pseudo SSN with today‘s date.  Let‘s further assume later in the afternoon on 
the  same  day,  15  Jan  2011,  a  baby  girl  is  born  to  MSgt  Johnson  and  Mr.  Johnson  at 1400hrs.  The CHCS will create a patient Pseudo SSN that looks like this:  801-11-0115.  
The  only  difference  between  this  temporary  patient  Pseudo  SSN  and  the  Pseudo  SSN created earlier for infant boy Smith is the inclusion of the number ―1‖ in the first three 
digits of the Pseudo SSN for infant girl Johnson.  Since this is the second infant or person registered into the local CHCS host computer server on the same date, the last number in 
the first  three-digit patient sequence number changes to ―1.‖  If a third infant  or  person was registered into the local CHCS host on the same day, the first last number in the first 
three-digit patient sequence number would change to ―802‖ or 802-11-0115. 4.9.11.3.  Newborn  infant  admissions  pose  a  unique  identity problem  within  the  MHS.  
During  CHCS  registration  there  is  very  little  personal/patient  identifying  information available.      Due  to  this  unique  situation,  extra  care  must  be  taken  when  registering  and 
identifying newborn infants.  Due to a lack of normal available patient identification, e.g., a  formal  Person  Identifier  and  even  a  full  patient  name,  the  practice  of  selecting  the 
correct  FMP  and  Sponsor  SSN  is  very  critical.    If  multiple  births  occur  (twins,  triplets, etc...) each infant should be clearly and consistently  identified  (SMITH,  INFANT  A, 
SMITH,  INFANT  B,  etc.).    Each  MTF  should  have  a  method  to  clearly  and  uniquely identify  newborns  in  addition  to  using  the  correct  FMP  and  Sponsor  SSN  and  have  a 
process in place to update a newborn‘s personal identification  as  soon  as  it  becomes available.  MTF admissions and dispositions personnel should encourage the sponsor to 
obtain a SSN for the child and then register their newborn child with DEERS as soon as possible.      Inaccurate   or   outdated   patient   information   associated   with   a   newborn 
admission,  if  not  updated  or  corrected,  can  also  negatively  impact  AHLTA.    Ensure 
----------------Page (126) Break----------------
  128  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
current MHS  guidelines are followed when merging/unmerging patients  within AHLTA and other interfaced systems. 
4.9.11.4.  Upon  birth,  register  an  infant  child  born  to  a  family  member  dependent daughter into CHCS using the PAT CAT ―F29‖ and FMP ―60.‖   The use of this PAT 
CAT  and  FMP  will  generate  a  bill  for  services.    The  bill  will  be  waived  if  Secretarial Designee  status  has  previously  been  granted.    Refer  to  paragraph  2.18.  for  information 
regarding  limited MTF  direct  healthcare  coverage  for  newborns  born to  family  member dependents under the Secretarial Designee Program. 
4.9.12.  ADDRESSING  AND  REGISTERING  OSI  AGENTS.    Address  military  Service Member agents of the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) as ―Special Agent,‖ followed by 
their last  name.   Refrain  from  addressing  a  military  Service  Member agent  using  his  or  her military rank. 
4.9.12.1.  When registering military Service Member OSI agents, into the EHR, enter the agent‘s rank as Airman Basic (E-1).  If an MTF staff members discovers an agent‘s rank 
has  automatically  changed  back  to  his  or  her  actual  military  service  rank  following  a healthcare eligibility verification or DEERS ―check‖ or following any event where CHCS 
and DEERS synchronize patient demographic information, ensure the agent‘s military service rank is changed again to ―Airman Basic.‖ 
4.9.12.2.  Some  security  experts  may  argue  that  any  accidental disclosure of an OSI‘s agent‘s military service rank could undermine the agent‘s ability to conduct current or 
future criminal investigations.  While the AFMS supports reasonable efforts to mask an agent‘s military rank to afford the individual some level  of  personal  identity  protection 
and/or  anonymity,  given  the  limited  ability  to  override  the  automatic  DEERS  sponsor identity  update  mechanism  that  populates  the  Military  Rank  field  in  CHCS,  the  actual 
military  rank  for  military  Service  Member  OSI  agents may  occasionally  be  visible  in CHCS and AHLTA. 
4.10.  Patients  with  Multiple-Eligibility.  Beneficiaries  are  registered  according  to  the  highest level  of  eligibility.    However,  patients  may  be  eligible  for  medical  and  dental  care  under  more 
than  one  FMP/SSN  and  patient  category,  or  PATCAT.    These  patients  pose  a  unique  problem and  careful  management  of  this  issue  must  be  fulfilled  to  prevent  cascading  effects  that  may 
negatively  impact  patient  safety,  continuity  of  care,  medical  records  tracking,  and  financial reimbursement  processes,  as  well  as  other  MHS  systems  that  use  CHCS  for  registration  and 
identity (for example, AHLTA).  Currently, CHCS is not designed to support patients that have multiple concurrent (or historic) eligibility categories, e.g., patients who are eligible or who once 
were  eligible  for  care  under  another  or  multiple  FMPs,  SSNs,  or  PATCATs.    Key  patient identifiers (the patient SSN and DoD ID Number) are only allowed to be used one time on any 
CHCS  host  computer  server.    However,  to  work  around  this  restriction,  patients  with  dual  or multiple-healthcare eligibility have been historically registered more than once using a ―Pseudo‖ 
SSN.    The  entry  of  more  than  one  SSN  into  CHCS  (for  the  same  patient)  fools  the  system  by inaccurately  identifying  the  patient  according  to  two  different  patient  identity  registration 
profiles. 4.10.1.  The practice of inserting or creating a ―Pseudo‖ or manufactured SSN into any 
CHCS patient registration data entry, so that a patient‘s healthcare  may  be  differentiated according  to  different  beneficiary  categories  for  which  the  patient  may  be  eligible,  may 
----------------Page (127) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   129  
temporarily solve an immediate records management, records tracking requirement, or third party insurance payer reimbursement requirement. This practice however, places the patient‘s 
safety at risk by fragmenting their medical history, to include medication and allergy profiles, into separate records.  Interfaced systems are affected by the ―splitting‖ or division of the 
patient‘s record within CHCS,  AHLTA,  etc.    FOR  THIS  REASON,  NO  PATIENT  (TO INCLUDE DUAL  OR  MULTIPLE HEALTHCARE ELIGIBILITY PATIENTS) SHOULD 
BE   PURPOSEFULLY   DUPLICATED   WITHIN   CHCS;   PATIENTS   SHOULD   BE REGISTERED  ONE  TIME  UNDER  THEIR  HIGHEST  LEVEL  OF  ELIGIBILITY.    This 
mandate  will certainly  cause  confusion  in  terms  of  records  tracking/filing  paperwork  and billing,  but  the  safety  of  the  patient  must  be  considered  above  all  other  factors.    When  a 
patient  is  identified  with  more  than  one  eligibility  account,  profile,  or  record,  and/or if clinical data has been entered under more than one record, FMPs, or SSNs, MTF TOPA staff 
or system managers are authorized to merge the duplicate records and ―alias‖ the surviving record  using  the  Former  Patient  Name  functionality  within  CHCS.    Changes must  be 
processed  IAW  current  MHS  merge/unmerge  guidelines.    While  this  practice  successfully merges or identifies duplicate multiple-eligibility patient accounts or records, this action does 
not correct duplicate records or entries already documented in AHLTA and other associated MHS automated systems.  Providers and MTF staff must be aware of the potential problems 
associated  with  dual  or  multiple-eligibility  patients  and  how  to  implement  corrective measures and alternative processes to ensure the patient‘s healthcare is properly documented.  
With  greater  emphasis  placed  upon  training  and  identification  of  multiple-eligible  patients during  the  initial  CHCS  registration  training  course  and  through  the  practice  of  limiting 
CHCS  registration  keys  to  users  who  truly  need  access,  future  occurrences  of  PIT  errors and/or record/account linking or ―aliasing‖ problems associated with accidental or purposeful 
registration  of  patients  with  more  than  one  eligibility  level,  are  expected  to  significantly decrease. 
4.10.2.  Securing  the  correct  patient  identity  for  patients  with  multiple  healthcare  eligibility categories  remains  a  noteworthy  AFMS  and  MHS  challenge.    Significant  issues  related  to 
dual  or  multiple  eligibility  (to  include  maintaining  multiple  hardcopy  records  for  the  same patient  while  having  one  electronic  record),  or  resolving  data  alignment  problems  between 
different  medical  systems  (such  as  FMP/SSN  discrepancies  between  CHCS,  AHLTA,  and DEERS using different identifiers for patient status) have not yet been resolved.  The medical 
facility‘s TOPA and MTF systems (IM/IT) personnel are responsible for ensuring all MTF personnel are aware of current policies and procedures designed to mitigate these problems, 
and  how  new  systems  or  procedures  may  impact  the  overall  patient  identity  process.    The TOPA  and  systems  offices  must  also  ensure  that  any  and  all  MTF  staff  members,  who 
possess  CHCS  registration  capabilities,  are  aware  of  the  problems  associated  with  multi-eligible  patients  and  other  current  patient  identity  problems.    Actions  that  may  lessen  the 
confusion  associated  with  these  particular  patients  are:    aliasing  a  patient  within  CHCS registration, noting a patient‘s multiple eligibility within CHCS registration, and placing 
records  aside  that  cannot  be  retired  properly  (patient  is  active  duty,  but  a  dependent  child record  exists  that  needs  to  be  retired  to  the  National  Personnel  Records  Center  (NPRC); 
collect  these  records  for  later  resolution).    Other  actions  include  cross-referencing  physical records when the patient has more than one physical record within the MTF (e.g., when the 
patient‘s highest level of eligibility is a dependent family member but he or she also has a Reserve  Component  health  record  within  the  MTF).    MTF  records  managers  should take 
----------------Page (128) Break----------------
  130  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
necessary steps to identify as many of their dual or multiple eligibility patients and keep track of their records for resolution when an acceptable ―work around‖ solution is identified.  
These actions may lessen, but will not completely eliminate the confusion caused by current system design deficiencies. 
4.10.3.  Potential  Duplicate  Patient  Report.    Produce  and  review  this  report  monthly  to identify  potential  duplicate  patients.    Research  each  error  and  develop  a  process  to  correct 
errors.   Incorrect  registration  information  should  be  corrected  or  edited.    All  duplicate registrations  should  be  merged  into  one  account  so  the  patient  is  registered  one  time  under 
that patient‘s highest level of eligibility, with all pertinent data moved under the  correct CHCS registration (patient SSN, DoD ID Number, FIN, TIN, etc.).  When necessary, records 
managers should take appropriate action to properly research each duplicate patient issue and merge,  retire,  or  forward  the  associated  hard-copy  health  records.    Patient  entries  on  the 
report  that  are  not  true  duplicate  patients  should  be  excluded.    Use  caution  before  merging any registration account or data regarding potential dual or multiple eligibility patients.  Use 
this  report  as  a  training  tool  when  specific  personnel  continuously  create  unnecessary duplicate accounts or make critical registration errors.  CHCS System Administrators, Patient 
Administration, and  Information Assurance officials will aggressively find, fix, and prevent unnecessary   duplicate patient   registrations.      Always   ensure   MHS   merging/unmerging 
guidelines  are  followed  when  resolving  patient  duplication  within  the  local  CHCS  host  or within AHLTA or other interfaced systems. 
4.10.4.  Only  one  patient  registration  entry  should  be  established  for  each  patient  treated  in the  MTF.    However,  there  are  instances  when  patients  have  multiple  eligibilities  or  are 
eligible  for  care under more than one patient  category.   In each of the examples below, the patients‘ eligibility and enrollment status, the SPONSOR/DEPENDENT relationship for each 
eligibility, and the possible presence of dependents must be considered when modifying the registration long-term or to address a change in eligibility for a specific patient care episode.  
It must be noted that CHCS/AHLTA cannot currently support every type of patient identity scenario; however, the following scenarios represent some of the most common examples of 
multiple eligible patients: 4.10.4.1.  When  the  patient  is  a  military  retiree  AND  a family-member  dependent,  for 
example, a retired Captain who is married to an active duty Major.  The retired Captain is likely  to  be  DEERS  eligible  under  his  or  her  own  SSN  and  also  eligible  for  care  under 
his/her spouse‘s SSN.  In this situation, the patient should be registered in the local MTF CHCS  host  under  the  patient  category  and  SSN  returned  by  the  automated  DEERS 
eligibility  interface  or  the  patient  category  and  SSN  that  is  most  advantageous  to  the patient.  Also consider that the patient‘s enrollment status to the MTF and the presence of 
dependent  patients  whose  eligibility  depends  on  the patient  will  be  deciding  factors.    In both  of  these  circumstances,  only  one  physical  record  should  exist  under  the  applicable 
FMP/SSN/terminal digit, cross-reference the patient using the CHCS ―alias‖ functionality to identify that there are current or historic multiple eligibilities. 
4.10.4.2.  When  a  patient  is  a  Reserve  Component  Service  Member  (RCSM)  and  a family-member  dependent.    For  example,  an  Air  Force  Reserve  SMSgt  assigned  to  a 
local  reserve  unit  who is  married  to  an  active  duty  TSgt.    This  situation will  depend  on the  eligibility  status  of  each  entitlement.    If  the  patient  is  an  enrolled  dependent  and  a 
RCSM,  but  is  not  an  activated  RCSM  (on  active  orders  for  30  or  more  days)  with 
----------------Page (129) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   131  
verifiable eligibility within DEERS (Health Care Delivery Plan) Code 001, 106, etc. the patient  should  appear  as  a  family-member  dependent  within  CHCS.    If  the  patient 
presents  for  care  as  a  RCSM  (for  example  treatment  for  a  periodic  RC  physical)  it  will not  be  possible  to  initiate  order  entry  procedures  or  view  the  patient  under  their  own 
FMP/SSN and correct PATCAT due to system registration limitations (without breaking the sponsor/dependent relationship and if enrollment to the MTF is present, it will not be 
possible to modify the registration).  If the RC patient is on active orders for 30 or more days,  (with  verifiable  eligibility  within  DEERS,  HCDP  106  or  001,  for  example)  the 
patient should be moved under their own FMP/SSN (although still enrolled to the MTF as a dependent, break the enrollment within CHCS, if needed).  Cross-reference the patient 
using the CHCS ―alias‖ functionality to identify that there is current or historic multiple eligibility (and cross-reference physical records, if possible).  In both cases, two physical 
records  will  be  present.    In  this  scenario,  a  RCSM,  not  on  active  orders  for  30  or  more days, but one who is seeking LOD service-related treatment at the same MTF where he or 
she  normally  is enrolled  as  a  dependent  will  likely  not  have  his  or  her  healthcare documented  under  their  own  FMP  and  SSN.    Later,  as  the  RCSM  separates  or  retires, 
identifying all of his or  her LOD service-related  healthcare encounters, so that potential VA   disability   evaluation   and/or   compensation   consideration   processes   may   be 
accomplished, will be challenging.  Air Force Medical Service leadership is aware of this issue.      However,   given   the   limited   registration   options   for   patient   with   multiple 
healthcare  eligibility  levels,  separating  or  ―breaking‖  a  patient‘s  medical  profile  or account to satisfy record keeping requirements may pose a greater patient safety concern. 
4.10.4.3.  When  a  patient  is  a  military  retiree  and  eligible  for  care  as  Veterans  Affairs beneficiary and a local VA-DOD joint sharing partnership exists.  The PATCAT for this 
type of patient may change based upon whether the retiree is being treated for injuries or illnesses that resulted from a service-related disability and whether or not he/she has been 
referred to the MTF from a VA medical facility.  This type of potential dual or multiple eligibility registration should not create a multiple ―same-patient‖ problem because the 
SSN  is  the  same  for  both  patient  categories  and  only  the  PATCAT  is  required  to  be changed  depending  on  the  type  of  care  required  for  each  episode  of  care.      In  both  of 
these cases, the patient‘s eligibility exists under the same FMP/SSN and one physical record should be present. 
4.10.4.4.  When  a  patient  is  an  authorized  family-member  dependent  and  a  federal civilian  employee,  the  patient  will  likely  be  DEERS  eligible  and  registered  in  the 
automated  CHCS  system  under  the  sponsor‘s  SSN  and  the  appropriate  dependent PATCAT.    However,  required  occupational  healthcare  and/or  emergency  healthcare 
associated   with   a   work-related   injury   or   illness   is   required   to   be   provided   and documented under the patient‘s SSN.  Note:  Automated DEERS eligibility interface will 
likely return ―Ineligible or Not Authorized for Care‖ under the patient‘s SSN.  However, similarly to other federal civilian employees with no other related beneficiary/eligibility 
status,  do  not  deny  care  to  treat  occupational-related  examination,  injuries,  or  illnesses.  In  this  situation  it  will  not  be  possible  to  initiate  order  entry  or  view  the  patient  under 
their  FMP/SSN  and  correct  PATCAT  due  to  system  registration  limitations  (without breaking  the  sponsor/dependent  relationship  and  if  enrollment  to  the  MTF  is  present,  it 
will  not  be  possible  to  modify  the  registration).    Cross-reference  the  patient  using  the 
----------------Page (130) Break----------------
  132  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
CHCS ―alias‖ functionality to identify that there is current or historic multiple eligibility.  In this case, a physical occupational health record and a dependent health record will be 
present (cross-reference physical records if possible). 4.10.4.5.  When  a  patient  is  a  federal  civilian  employee  and  a  RCSM,  the  patient  will 
likely  be  registered  in  DEERS  under  his/her  SSN  as  a  reservist  or  guardsman  and  will likely  be  registered  in  the  automated  CHCS  system  under  his/her  SSN,  appropriate 
sponsor  FMP  and  PATCAT.    However,  required  local,  state,  or  federal  occupational healthcare examinations and/or emergency healthcare visits associated from an employee 
work-related  injury  or  illness  are  required  to be  provided  under  the  federal  employee PATCAT.  This type of potential dual or multiple eligibility registration should not create 
a  multiple  ―same-patient‖  problem  because  the  SSN  is  the  same  for  both  patient categories and only the PATCAT is required to be changed depending on the type of care 
required for each episode of care.  Two physical records will be present for this patient, (occupational  health  and  reserve  record,  cross-reference  physical  records,  if  possible) 
when there is documentation of care/treatment under both patient statuses. 4.10.5.  The  PATCAT  is  not  static  and  can  be  changed;  however,  it  is  not  automatically 
updated when the beneficiary‘s status changes in DEERS.  The PATCAT can and must be changed  within  CHCS  by  MTF  personnel, when  required.    Careful  attention  must  be  paid 
when  booking  appointments  or  admitting  patients  to  ensure  that  the  episode  of  care  is documented under the appropriate PATCAT.  Improperly booking appointments or admitting 
dual  or  multiple  eligibility  patients  under  the  wrong  PATCAT  may  have  a  significant negative  impact  to  continuity  of  care,  medical  records  tracking,  and  potential  third  party 
collection processes.  One example of this potential negative impact:  When dual or multiple-eligibility is present, completion or performance of the order/entry process within CHCS may 
not produce the desired effects if the action is prescribed using an incorrect PAT CAT. 4.10.6.  Managing EHR Patient Registration errors, now and in the future.   The deployment 
of  AHLTA  and  the  advent  of  the  EHR  pose  new  challenges  for  TOPA  and  the  AFMS.  CHCS  registration  errors,  to  include  purposeful  and  accidental  CHCS  patient  duplication, 
prior to AHLTA‘s deployment, only affected the local CHCS host (and some interfaced systems).    However,  now that  the  MHS  has  deployed  AHLTA,  a  single  patient  registration 
error for a patient with multiple healthcare eligibility levels at one MTF has the potential to cause  significant  patient  safety  and  records  management  problems  that  extend beyond  the 
patient‘s primary MTF to other MTFs that share access to AHLTA and the Central Data Repository.  Patient registration, if not completed properly, causes patient duplication within 
AHLTA and can lead to demographic data errors.  TOPA and Information Systems officials should work together to develop a process for identifying and correcting these errors as they 
are   encountered   within   AHLTA   while   following   current   MHS   guidelines   on   patient merging/unmerging and error correction within AHLTA and CHCS. 
4.10.7.  Variations in the patient‘s identifiers (FMP/SSN) are to be expected between the AHLTA  record  and  the  local  CHCS  host.    This  may  be  due  to  the  current  controlled 
―freezing‖ of some of the updates to the FMP/SSN within AHLTA from the CHCS hosts, as well  as  the  AHLTA  record  being  linked  to  multiple  CHCS  hosts  where  the  patient  is 
registered under different FMP/SSNs.  A patient‘s concurrent or historical multiple-eligibility categories  could  complicate  this  problem  as  the  patient  may  appear  under  more  than  one 
FMP/SSN in both CHCS and AHLTA.  TOPA officials should explain any record-related or 
----------------Page (131) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   133  
dual or multiple-eligibility identity management problems with the affected patient to prevent confusion  and  ensure  the  patient  is  aware  of  the  system  limitations.    Follow  current  MHS 
demographic  error  (including  FMP  and  SSN  error)  correction  guidelines  when  addressing registration  errors  and  inconsistencies  within  and  between  AHLTA  and  CHCS  as  well  as 
other interfaced systems.

4.12.1.  Travel  Reimbursement/Funding.    For  patients enrolled  to  a  direct  care  MTF,  the travel  benefit  is  administered  by  the  MTF.    For  patients  enrolled  to  a  network  PCM,  the 
TRICARE  Regional  Office  administers  the  travel  benefit.  Travel  costs  for  non-Air  Force military  Service  Members  are  the  responsibility of the Service Member‘s and their family 
members‘ respective Service branch. 4.12.2.  TRICARE  Prime  Travel  Benefit.  When  MTF  TRICARE  Prime  enrollees  (family 
members  or  military  retirees)  are  referred  by  their  primary  care  manager  (PCM)  for medically necessary, non-emergency specialty care to a location greater than 100 miles from 
the referring PCM‘s office, the patient must be reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses in accordance with the JFTR (U7960). Travel expenses are charged to the MTF. 
4.12.2.1.  Military  retirees  with  a  combat-related  disability  who  are  not  enrolled  in TRICARE Prime.  When a retired Service Member with a combat-related disability, who 
is  not  a  TRICARE  Prime  enrollee,  is  referred  by  a  PCM  for  follow-on  specialty  care, 
----------------Page (132) Break----------------
  134  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
services  and  supplies,  for  that  particular  disability,  to  a  location  greater  than  100  miles from  where  the  military  retiree  resides,  the  patient  must  be  reimbursed  for  reasonable 
travel  expenses. Note: The  TRICARE  Regional  Office  located  in  the  region where  the retiree resides determines if the specialty care is more than 100 miles from the retiree‘s 
residence.    Transportation  expenses  are  reimbursed  for  the  official  distance  from  the patient‘s  residence  city  to  the  specialty  care  provider‘s  city.    This  also  applies  to 
subsequent specialty referrals authorized by a primary care provider. 4.12.3.  Non-Medical  Attendant  Travel.    Non-medical  attendants  (NMA)  are  appointed  by 
medical  authority.    Local  area  travel/transportation  expense  coverage  is  authorized  when serving  as  a  NMA  for  a  Service  Member  traveling  on  official  business.    Non-medical 
attendants  assisting  patients  who  are  referred  to  medical  facilities  located  beyond  the  local Permanent  Duty  Station  (PDS)  area  will  be  reimbursed  travel/transportation  expenses  in 
accordance  with  the  Joint  Federal  Travel  Regulation  (JFTR)  or  Joint  Travel  Regulation (JTR), whichever is applicable. 
4.12.3.1.  Active  Duty  and  RCSMs  (on  Active  Duty  status)  may  travel  as  NMAs  to support  an  immediate  family member  TRICARE  beneficiary  at  the  recommendation  of 
the  attending  physician.    Service  academy  cadets  and  ROTC  cadets  may  not  travel  as NMAs. 
4.12.3.2.  Non-Concurrent NMA Travel.  Non-concurrent NMA travel may be authorized or approved when the need for an attendant arises during treatment or when there is need 
for an attendant only during a portion of the patient's travel. 4.12.4.  Civil  Service  Family  Member  of  a  Seriously  Ill  or  Injured  Uniformed  Service 
Member.   A   civilian   employee,   who   is   authorized   travel   under   a   competent   travel authorization/order as a family member of an Active Duty Service Member who is seriously 
ill, seriously injured, or when death is imminent, is treated as an employee in a TDY status.  A  TDY  travel  authorization/order for a family member‘s travel per JFTR (U5246) must be 
issued  and  cite  JTR  C7800  as  the  authority.    Refer  to  para  4.38.  (Reporting  Patients  in Casualty  Status), and  para  4.40.  relating  to  the Emergency  Family  Member Travel  (EFMT) 
Program.    Consult the local  EFMT  representative  (typically  the Casualty  Affairs  office) for further guidance. 
4.12.4.1.  Travel  for  Families  of  Inpatient  Service  Members  who  are  VSI/SI,  or  Hostile NSI.    Travel  for  Family  members  of  inpatient  Service  Members  who  are  VSI/SI  or 
Hostile  NSI  is  governed  by  the  Emergency  Family  Member  Travel  (EFMT)  Program (AFI 36-3002 para 2.27, 37 U.S.C. § 411h).  EFMT is not funded by the MTF.  EFMT is 
centrally funded by the Air Force, and managed by AFPC/DPWC. 4.12.5.  Medical  Referrals  within  the   Local  PDS  Area.    Travel  by   personally  owned 
conveyance  (POC)  to  obtain  medical  care  within  the  local  PDS  area  is  reimbursable  only when a Service Member is ordered (see note below) to a medical facility within the local area 
to  take  a  required  physical  examination,  or  to  obtain  a  medical  diagnosis  and/or  treatment.  When  ordered,  Service  Members  are  considered  to  be  on  official  business  and  must  be 
reimbursed  for  the  transportation,  unless  government  transportation  is  available  (see  JFTR U3500).  Note: ―Ordered‖ in this context is defined as an order/command that could result in 
disciplinary action if not obeyed (e.g., commander-directed).

4.12.5.1.  Medical  Referral  Travel  at  the  Member‘s  Expense.    Travel  to  medical appointments within  the  PDS  other  than  as  described  in  the  above  paragraph  is  not 
reimbursable.    Service  Members  traveling  on  official  travel  orders  outside  the  PDS  are authorized  travel  and  transportation  allowances  in  accordance  with  the  JFTR.    Travel 
must be authorized by the proper medical authority. 4.12.6.  Medical  Referral  Travel  for  Government  Employees  Overseas  and  Their  Family 
Members. When local medical facilities (military or civilian) at a foreign OCONUS area are not  able  to  accommodate  an  employee‘s needs, transportation to another location may be 
authorized when seeking appropriate medical/dental care.  Healthcare related travel expenses are funded by the employee‘s unit.  Travel and transportation expenses and/or reimbursement 
are authorized in accordance with the JTR. 4.12.7.  Convalescent  Leave Transportation  for  Illness/Injury.  (Reference JFTR U7210 and 
37 U.S.C. § 411a).  A Service Member is authorized transportation allowances (without per diem)  for  one  trip  when  traveling  for  convalescent  leave  for  illness/injury  incurred  while 
eligible for hostile fire pay under 37 U.S.C. § 310. The convalescent travel will be funded by the  fund  cite  on  the  member's  deployment  travel  orders.  TDY  orders  are  prepared  by  the 
member‘s unit. 4.12.8.  Travel and Per Diem Allowance.  Service Members traveling to a medical facility to 
obtain  an  examination  or  when  traveling  to  Lackland  AFB  TX  to  attend  a  formal  Physical Evaluation  Board  (PEB),  receive  travel  and  per  diem  (including  meals  and  lodging) 
allowance based on their retired grade (10 U.S.C. § 1210 and JFTR volume 1, Chapter 7, Part 1).    The  Service  Member  is  authorized  an  escort  to  accompany  him  or  her  to  the  place  of 
examination  when  the  he  or  she  is  not  physically  or  mentally  able  to  travel without assistance. Approximately 20-30 days prior to the reporting date, HQ AFPC/DPSD will send 
travel orders to the Service Member.  The order will indicate the exact date, time and place to report and includes the authority for payment of travel costs.  The destination or examining 
medical facility will endorse the order with the date and time the Service Member reported as verification  that  the  Service  Member  was  examined  as  an  inpatient  or  outpatient.    The 
endorsement   also   serves   to   verify   the   Service Member   was   released   following   the examination.    If  the  Service  Member  received  his  or  her  examination  as  an  outpatient,  the 
destination  MTF  must  indicate  whether  the  Service  Member  occupied  government  quarters during his or her stay.  The examining or destination facility must ensure the Service Member 
has an indorsed order to submit the claim for reimbursement.  Upon return to the departure location, the Service Member is required to submit a travel voucher to their local accounting 
and finance office to obtain reimbursement for travel-related expenses.  Refer to the JFTR for further travel entitlement information.

Section 4D—Quarters Administration 
4.14.  Quarters Status. 4.14.1.  Quarters  is  a  full  duty  excuse  provided  to  active  duty  uniformed  service  members 
receiving medical or dental treatment for a disease or injury that, based on sound professional judgment, does not require inpatient care.  A ―quarters‖ patient is treated on an outpatient 
basis, and is to remain in their home during the quarters period.  Quarters periods generally last 24-72 hours depending on the providers prescribed rest/recovery period. 
4.14.2.  The  provider  or  support  staff  will  notify  the  member‘s  unit  commander  or commander‘s  designee  regarding  the  patient‘s  quarters  status.    Refer to  Chapter  6  for 
commander  designee  processes.    Command  authority  notification  must  be  documented  on DD  Form  689,  Individual  Sick  Slip,  or  a  locally  created  form.    See  Attachment  3  for  an 
example.  Disclose only  the minimum information necessary  and account for the disclosure in the PHIMT or MTF approved centralized disclosure accounting tool.  Notwithstanding any 
other  installation  document  creation  and  approval  mechanism,  the  Health  Records  Review Committee  must  approve  locally  created  clinical  forms.    Forward  a  copy  of  the  quarters 
notification or sick slip to the member‘s unit Commander or authorized representative to receive  quarters  information.    Provide  a  second  copy  to  the  member  so  he/she  may  give  it 
[quarters sick slip] to their supervisor. 4.14.3.  Develop local procedures for program management, including, but not limited to: 
4.14.3.1.  Notifying Public Health for communicable disease tracking. 4.14.3.2.  Mechanism for extending quarters past the initial rest period. 
4.14.4.  Non-Physician Restrictions: Physician assistants/nurse practitioners may not place a patient on quarters for longer than 48 hours without approval by a physician. 
4.14.5.  Obstetrical  Quarters:    As  a  general  rule,  Obstetrical  (OB)  Quarters  should  be  the primary method for managing OB patients with prenatal medical issues when continued duty 
must be temporarily limited or suspended.  The use of OB Quarters is designed for on-going medical  issues  that  may  require  medical  re-evaluation,  not convalescence,  which  implies  a 
period  of  recovery.    For  ongoing  medical  problems  during  pregnancy,  providers  are encouraged  to  use  quarters  and  the  profile  system  rather  than  recommending  convalescent 
leave.    Definitive  OB  quarters  guidelines  are  discussed in  AFI  44-102,  Medical  Care Management. 
4.14.6.  Unit  Commanders  and  supervisors  have  the  authority  to  grant  up  to  24  hours  sick status at their discretion if a member‘s illness/injury does not require MTF intervention.  If 
the illness/injury persists beyond 24 hours, then the Commander or supervisor must refer the member to the MTF for treatment and subsequent clinical examination. 
Section 4E—Line of Duty (LOD) Program Administration 
4.15.  LOD Determinations. 4.15.1.  Authority:    AFI  36-2910,  Line  of  Duty  (Misconduct)  Determination  and  AFI  36-
3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement and Separation. 
----------------Page (135) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   137  
4.15.2.  According  to  AFI  36-2910, an LOD determination, ―Is a finding made after an investigation  into the circumstances of a member‘s illness, injury, disease or death.‖  A 
service member who dies or is injured due to his or her own misconduct may lose substantial government benefits. 
4.15.3.  Following  the  start  of  a  LOD  determination,  initial  direct  care  and/or  TRICARE network healthcare may not be denied to any ADSM or RCSM. 
4.15.4.  Following the completion of a LOD determination: 4.15.4.1.  Direct  care  and/or  TRICARE  network  healthcare  may  not  be  denied  to  any 
ADSM for which a LOD determination of Not in Line of Duty is found or identified. 4.15.4.2.  Continued  direct  care  and/or  TRICARE  network  healthcare  entitlements  of 
RCMS  may  be  impacted  by  LOD  determinations.    See  para.  4.15.13  for  specific guidance. 
4.15.5.  The LOD determination process is a Line of the Air Force program.  The Air Force Medical   Service   is   not   the   Office   of   Primary   Responsibility.      However,   the   LOD 
determination process is initiated with a medical officer‘s review of the member‘s illness, injury,  disease,  or  death.  The  LOD  determination  process  must  be  accomplished  IAW  AFI 
36-2910. 4.15.6.  Refer   to   AFI   36-2910   for   information   regarding   when   to   initiate   a   LOD 
determination. 4.15.7.  The Service Member‘s personnel status and branch of Service usually dictates what 
type of LOD form should be used when initiating a LOD determination case. 4.15.7.1.  For ADSMs and members of the Air National Guard, MTF providers must use 
the AF Form 348. 4.15.7.2.  For Air Force Reserve members, MTF providers must use the AFRC Form 348. 
4.15.7.3.  For Service Members assigned to other Service branches (i.e., US Army, Navy, Marines) Air Force MTF providers should use the specific Service LOD form or the DD 
Form 261, Report of Investigation Line of Duty and Misconduct Status when initiating a LOD determination case. 
4.15.7.4.  Most  illnesses  and  injuries  sustained  by  Service  Members  in  an  active  duty status or in IDT status are presumed to have occurred In the Line of Duty unless one of 
the  specific  LOD  determination/case  initiation  triggers  or  mandatory  circumstantial occurrences,  identified  in  AFI  36-2910,  is  identified  that  would  otherwise  cancel  the 
automatic  presumption  and  require  the  initiation  of  the  LOD  determination  process.  Refer  to  AFI  36-2910  for  definitive  information  regarding  when  to  initiate  a  LOD 
determination for ADSMs and RCSMs. 4.15.8.  For  ADSMs,  the  inability  to  perform  one‘s  job  for  24  hours  or  more,  and  the 
subsequent  placement  upon  simple Quarters  for  minor  injuries  and  illnesses  (including obstetrical quarters) will likely not require the submission of an AF Form 348 provided: 
4.15.8.1.  None  of  the  mandatory  circumstantial  factors  or  LOD  determination/case initiation ―triggers,‖ identified by AFI 36-2910, are present. 
----------------Page (136) Break----------------
  138  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.15.8.2.  The  injury  or  illness  is  minor  and  meets  the  criteria  provided  under  the Administrative LOD Determination allowances of AFI 36-2910. 
4.15.9.  If an injured RCSM is taken to a non-MTF for care, the medical officers assigned to the  MTF  or  RCMU  who  provided  the  initial  treatment  or  had  first  contact  with  the  RCSM 
should initiate the LOD determination process. 4.15.10.  The medical officer initiating the AF Form 348 will complete blocks 1-12 of the AF 
Form 348, sign, stamp or type his/her printed name and title, and date the form.  The provider will  then  contact  the  appropriate  MTF  or  RC  LOD  patient  administration  representative  to 
initiate   the   administrative   coordination   process.      The   LOD   patient   administration representative shall ensure that all applicable supporting medical documents and/or any other 
medical-related  incident  or  information  reports  are  attached  to  the  AF  Form  348  before forwarding  the  package  to  the  appropriate  officials  designated  in  AFI  36-2910.    The  LOD 
administrative representative will fill in the ―TO, THRU, and FROM‖ blocks at the top of the form. 
4.15.11.  In  cases  where  the  healthcare  provider  has  determined  an  LOD  determination review is required for an inpatient admission, the admitting clerk must obtain the time, place, 
and manner of occurrence of the incident from the patient, other witnesses, and/or available sources  and  records  the  information  on  the  reverse  of  the  AF  Form  560,  Authorization  and 
Treatment Statement.  Again, the initiating provider completes the appropriate blocks on the AF  Form  348,  signs  the  form  and  coordinates  with  the  appropriate  MTF  or  RCMU  LOD 
representative.   The  LOD representative  will  forward the package  to  the  Service  Member‘s MPS. 
4.15.12.  The MTF or RCMU LOD representative shall be appointed in writing by the MTF or RCMU Commander.  The LOD representative is responsible for: 
4.15.12.1.  Educating  MTF  or  RCMU  staff  on  medical  responsibilities  for  the  LOD process. 
4.15.12.2.  Accurate and timely processing of all LODs within the MTF. 4.15.12.3.  Routing  LODs  to  the  appropriate  MPS  special  actions  unit  or  RC  personnel 
processing office IAW AFI 36-2910. 4.15.12.4.  Ensuring  LODs  are  initiated  for  local  unit  attached  IMA  and  Participating 
Individual Ready Reserves (PIRR) reservists. 4.15.12.5.  Identifying  cases  requiring  LOD  and  determinations  for  active  duty  and 
RCSMs. 4.15.12.6.  Ensuring  the  appropriate  medical  officer  signs  the  AF  Form  348  before 
distributing the AF Form 348 as follows: 4.15.12.6.1.  Original:    Forward  the  original  and  all  supporting  medical  summaries 
and  supporting  documentation  to  the  member‘s  servicing  MPS  Special  Actions Office. 
4.15.12.6.2.  Copy: File one copy in the member‘s inpatient or outpatient medical record, as applicable. 
4.15.12.6.3.  Copy:  File one copy in the LOD-MFP Office.

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   139  
4.15.13.  LOD Requirements for Members of the RC.  Reference AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct)   Determination   and   AFI   36-3212,   Physical   Evaluation   for   Retention, 
Retirement and Separation. 4.15.13.1.  Government   sponsored   (Direct   Care   or   TRICARE)   healthcare   is   not 
authorized  at  government  expense  beyond  the  period  of  IDT  or ―drill‖ status orders for any medical condition that is determined to be ―Not in Line of Duty.‖  Attempts to 
complete Line of Duty determinations should occur prior to the end of the AD orders. 4.15.13.2.  If  an  injured  RCSM  is  taken  to  a  non-MTF  for  care,  the  medical  officers 
assigned  to  the  MTF  or  RCMU  who  provided  the  initial  treatment  or  had  first  contact with the RCSM should initiate the LOD determination process as the LOD determination 
process  should  be  accomplished  at  the  first  opportunity.  If  the  LOD  determination process cannot be initiated by the point of first contact, the process will be initiated by the 
RCSM‘s  servicing  MTF  or  RCMU.    The  LOD  determination  process  must  be accomplished IAW AFI 36-2910. 
4.15.13.3.  Air Force Reservists:   If the MTF initiates the AF  Form 348 or AFRC Form 348, the form must be submitted to the reservist‘s Air Force Reserve unit or to the Air 
Force Reserve medical unit (AFRMU) responsible for uploading the information into the Duty Determination Management System (DDMS).  The AFRMU will initiate the AFRC 
Form 348 through the RC DDMS. 4.15.13.4.  For IMA and PIRR Service Members:  The MTF should initiate an AF Form 
348  (1st  side  with  provider  signature)  and  forward  to  the  Base  IMA  Administrator (BIMAA)  for  routing  and  input  into  the DDMS application.    Notification  of  HQ  ARPC 
and AFRC/SGP of initiated LODs for IMA and PIRR Service Members is not necessary.  Instead, the Service Member‘s BIMAA should be notified. 
4.15.13.5.  Air National Guard Service Members:  The medical officers who first provide treatment  or  the medical  officers stationed  nearest  to  the non-Air Force  medical  facility 
that   first   provide   treatment,   in   cooperation   with   the   MTF   or   RCMU   patient administration or LOD representative should initiate the AF Form 348. 
4.15.13.6.  If the MTF initiates the AF Form 348, the form must be submitted to the ANG Service Member‘s unit or to the ANG medical unit (ANGMU) responsible for uploading 
the  information  into  the  Duty  Determination  Management  System  (DDMS).    The  Air National Guard Service Member‘s unit or the ANGMU will initiate the automated AF 
Form 348 through the DDMS. 4.15.13.7.  Any RCSM seeking government sponsored healthcare must produce at least a 
partially  completed  AF  Form  348  (1st  side  completed  and  signed  by  the  provider initiating  the  LOD  determination  process)  or  an  AFRC  Form  348  (with  sections  1-5 
completed  and  signed  by  the  provider  initiating  the  LOD  determination  process).    The partially  completed  LOD  determination  form  may  be  used  as  healthcare  eligibility 
verification  source  when  the  Service  Member  seeks  government  sponsored  healthcare without  possessing  current  active  duty  status  orders  or  when  a  DEERS  healthcare 
eligibility check indicates no current coverage. 
----------------Page (138) Break----------------
  140  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.15.13.8.  If an LOD determination cannot be made before the tour of duty ends, and the individual  requires  further  hospitalization  or  treatment,  continue  with  any  necessary 
healthcare related to the potentially service-connected injury or illness. 4.15.13.9.  If  the  final  determination  is  ―Not  in  Line  of  Duty,‖  medical  care  at 
government  expense  ends.    Document  the  notification  of  the  LOD  determination  in  the patient's medical record(s).  If the Service Member is still hospitalized, advise the patient 
that  as  of  the  day  of  notification,  care  will  be  provided  at  the  full  reimbursement  rate (FRR) until transfer to a civilian medical facility. 
4.15.13.10.  If  the  final  LOD  determination  is  ―In  Line  of  Duty,‖  document  the notification and advise the patient that care continues at government expense. 
4.15.13.11.  ―Provisional‖ LOD Determination for Healthcare:  An informal or formal LOD investigation, still ongoing, and where a final LOD determination has not yet been 
determined.    A  Provisional  LOD  determination  for  Healthcare  is  comprised  of  the completed medical portion (front part) of the AF Form 348 (with a provider signature) or 
the completed sections 1-5 and provider signature on the AFRC Form 348 for Air Force Reservists.  Each form should contain a description of the Service Member‘s illness, 
injury or disease, and date of occurrence.  IAW AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination, the military officer‘s signature does NOT constitute a completed LOD 
determination.    The  Provisional  LOD  determination  for  Healthcare  is  used  to  provide eligibility  for  direct  or  TRICARE  network  healthcare  when  DEERS  indicates  a  RCSM 
may  not  be  eligible  for  medical  or  dental  benefits.    In  other  words,  the  completed  first side of  the  AF  Form  348  or  completed  sections  1-5  of  the  AFRC  348  (including  a 
provider signature for each form) may be used to verify a RCSM‘s entitlement to medical care at government expense when not on active duty orders. 
Section 4F—Air Force Secretarial Designee Program Administration 
4.16.  Authority.  Title  32,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  Part  108  and  DoDI  6025.23, Health Care Eligibility Under the Secretarial Designee Program and Related Special Authorities. 
The use of regulatory  authority to establish DoD healthcare eligibility for  individuals without a specific statutory entitlement or eligibility shall be used very sparingly, and only when it serves a 
compelling  DoD  mission  interest.    The  Secretary  of  Defense  (or  his/her  designee)  and/or  the Secretary of the Army, Navy, and Air Force may designate individuals not otherwise entitled, for 
DoD healthcare (medical and dental) in military MTFs, per AFI 36-3026V1_IP.  Emergency care (life/limb/eyesight/relief  of  undue  suffering)  does  not  require  Secretarial  Designee  (SECDES) 
status.    Under  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  Mission  Directive  1-6,  the  Secretary  of  the  Air Force  (SECAF)  has  delegated  authority  to  the  Administrative  Assistant  to  the  Secratery  of  the 
Air  Force  (SAF/AA).    Healthcare  authorized  under  this  section  shall  be  provided  on  a reimbursable basis, unless non-reimbursable care is authorized by this instruction or waived by 
the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, OUSD (P&R) or the Secretaries  of  the  Military  Departments  as  the  approving  authorities.  The  level  of  benefit  and 
reimbursement rate is determined by the Service, using Service-specific criteria. 4.16.1.  Reciprocity  Among  all  Military  Departments.  Secretarial  Designees  from  other 
Military Departments may receive treatment in Air Force MTFs based upon, but not limited 
----------------Page (139) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   141  
to,  the  capabilities  of  the  MTF  professional  staff,  availability  of  space  and  facilities,  and MTF proximity to the individual's home address. 
4.16.2.  Each approved Secretary of the Air Force Designee must obtain a signed letter from the  SAF/AA  establishing  eligibility  for  care.    Exceptions:  When  an  MTF  Commander 
authorizes  care  for  newborns  of  dependent  daughters  as  referenced  in  paragraph  2.18  and when an  overseas  MAJCOM  Command  Surgeon  authorizes  healthcare  for  family  member 
dependents  of  contractors  as  referenced  in  paragraph  2.38.    The  letter  will  include  an effective date, coverage period, aeromedical evacuation/transport determination, the specific 
treatment  or  care  authorized  in  relation  to  the  specific  medical  condition/incident,  and  the rate (charges) for care.  The letter must reflect that care is authorized at the designated MTF 
only. 4.16.3.  Authorization does not entitle a Designee to utilize TRICARE benefits/entitlements; 
however,  it  does  include  a  supplemental  care  benefit  for  diagnostic  procedures  only.  Approved  Designees  receive  space-available care at the MTF Commander‘s determination.  
Unless  the  authorization  letter  specifies otherwise,  individual  Designees  may  not  use  the aeromedical evacuation system.   If aeromedical evacuation becomes a requirement after the 
SAF/AA   has   approved   the   initial   request,   a   supplemental   Designee   request   must   be submitted.   Designated MTF personnel may contact AFMOA/SGAT for assistance. 
4.16.4.  The SAF/AA may authorize care for up to two years.  This program is not intended to  provide  life-long  medical  care.    Individuals  may  request  renewal  of  Designee  status  and 
reapply  for  Designation  as outlined  in  this  chapter,  however  continued  approval  is  not guaranteed.  Secretarial Designee requests will not be approved for financial or humanitarian 
purposes. 4.16.5.  Individuals  being  considered  for  Secretarial  Designee  status  (not  currently eligible 
for  care)  shall  not  receive  treatment  at  Air  Force  MTFs  until  Designee  status  has  been approved.    An  exception  to  this  requirement  is  Extracorporeal  Membrane  Oxygenation 
(ECMO),  or  partial  heart-lung  bypass.    In  this  situation,  the  MTF  is  required  to  initiate  a verbal request via telephone communication with the SAF/AA. 
4.16.6.  MTF  Secretarial  Designee  Program  Managers  should  educate  MTF  professionals, medical  support  (outpatient  &  inpatient)  and  ancillary  staff  members  of  the  purpose  of the 
Secretarial   Designee   Program   and   its   basic   requirements.      Clinical  professionals   and immediate  medical  support  staff  are  best  positioned  to  identify  patients  who  may  benefit 
from  potential  Secretarial  Designee  status.    If  Secretarial  Designee  status  is identified  as  a potential  option,  clinicians  and  medical  support  staff,  either  through  the  normal  course  of 
treatment  for  an  MHS  beneficiary  for  whom  healthcare  benefits  are  soon  to  expire  or  from the presentation of a civilian emergency patient, should proactively determine eligibility loss 
date  and  submit  an  application  in  a  timely  manner.    MTF  requests  must  be  received  by AFMOA/SGAT  no  later  than  30  days  prior  to  expiration  of  medical  benefits.    Individuals 
who  have  lost  their  military  medical  benefits and  are  being  considered  for  Secretarial Designee status will no longer receive treatment at Air Force MTFs until Designee status has 
been  approved.    Situations  where  patient  healthcare  eligibility  has  expired  and  SECDES approval has not been granted could potentially leave the patient without healthcare coverage 
and/or  force  the  applicant  to  incur  a  financial  burden,  especially  if  the  Designee  request  is disapproved.  Application denials for healthcare already provided will automatically generate 
----------------Page (140) Break----------------
  142  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
charges  at  the  FRR.    Retroactive  requests  should  be  limited  to  absolute  unavoidable situations  such  as  short-notice  separations  or  emergency  care.    The  MTF  must  notify 
AFMOA/SGAT immediately of urgent cases. 4.16.7.  Each  application  shall  include  a  100%  DEERS  and  ID check  to  verify  the  status  of 
the patient and sponsor . 4.17.  US  Air  Force  Secretarial  Designee  Criteria.  Individuals  who meet  one  or  more  of  the 
following  criteria  may  apply  for  Secretarial  Designee  status  through  the  requesting  MTF  using the format in Attachment 6. 
4.17.1.  Military is Only Source of Care.  This category is appropriate for patients (currently ineligible for DoD medical care) for whom the MHS is the only source of care, for example, 
patients  who  may  benefit from  urgent  or  emergency  hyperbaric  medicine  oxygen  therapy which is not commonly available in the civilian sector, may apply for Designee status. 
4.17.2.  Teaching Case.  When the case presents a unique teaching opportunity for the MTF staff  or  residency  programs,  an  individual  may  request  Designee  status.    If  this  option  is 
selected,  the  MTF  attending  physician  or  primary  physician  advocate  must  include  a thorough, written, signed statement that identifies the specific benefits to the Air Force.  The 
application should then be endorsed by the attending physician‘s department chairperson, the Director of Graduate Medical Education, and the Chief of the Medical Staff.  Each signature 
is required to validate the teaching significance of the case.  For example, the case is critical for  continued  accreditation  of  a  training  program;  is  an  extremely  rare  case;  the  case  is  a 
necessary part of a training program protocol and the patient ―case mix‖ is not available in the beneficiary population.  MTF healthcare will, under most circumstances, be provided at 
the FMR. 4.17.3.  SAF/AA Delegated Approval Authority Programs. 
4.17.3.1.  Civilian  Trauma  Program.    Upon  expiration  of  eligibility  initially  established through  this  program,  additional  or  continued  care  requires  a  SECDES  application  and 
approval  by  the  SAF/AA.    If  approved,  the  Designee  will  pay  the  FRR  for  healthcare provided  under  the  SECDES  program.    Currently  the  only  exception  is  if  the  SECDES 
application utilizes the criteria of ―Best Interests of the Air Force.‖ 4.17.3.2.  ECMO    Program    (partial    heart-lung    bypass).        If    a    patient    requires 
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) or partial heart-lung by-pass, the MTF will initiate the application with a verbal request to the SAF/AA.  The full and complete 
electronic application shall follow within 24 hours. 4.17.3.3.  HIV Research Program. 
4.17.4.  Best Interest of the Air Force.  This category of Designees includes those for whom it  is  in  the  best  interest  of the  Air  Force  to  provide  continued  care.    For  cases  when  the 
justification  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  government,  include  a  letter  from  the  MTF, addressing  the  effects  of  denying  Designee  status  (e.g.,  litigation  risk,  cost,  negative  press 
coverage).  Cases will be reviewed by the MTF law consultant or base Legal Office, and will be included as part of the Designee request.  Care will under most circumstances be provided 
at the FMR. 
----------------Page (141) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   143  
4.17.5.  Continuity  of  Care.    If  continuity  of  care  is  a  significant  clinical  issue  in  the individual's course of treatment and civilian medical care is not available or appropriate, this 
individual  may  request  Designee  status.    For  cases  when  the  justification  is  continuity  of care, the case must be medically supportable.   Include a statement on the medical impact if 
the Air Force were to deny the individual Designee status.  Care will generally be provided at the FRR. 
4.17.5.1.  Obstetrics, Maternal, and Pediatric Care Sub-Category: The MTF Commanders or designated representative may approve Designee status for applicants identified below 
at  the  FMR.    MTF  healthcare  is  generally  limited  to  pre-partum  obstetrical  care,  MTF newborn delivery, one post-partum check-up (for the mother), one post-partum well-baby 
outpatient  visit  for  the  infant  and  any  necessary  immunizations  for  the  infant  to  be provided no later than six weeks following delivery. 
4.17.5.1.1.  Newborns of eligible family member daughters. 4.17.5.1.2.  Pregnant former Active Duty members and their newborns. 
4.17.5.1.3.  Spouses of former Active Duty and their newborns. 4.17.5.1.4.  Family  member  dependent  daughters  who  became  pregnant  prior  to 
losing eligibility. 4.17.6.  Involuntary  Separation.    If  a  sponsor  is  involuntarily  separated  for  medical  reasons 
under  honorable  conditions  and  the  sponsor's  wife  is  pregnant,  the  wife  may  request Designee status. 
4.17.7.  Abused Family Members/Dependents.  This section is only applicable if all or some transitional benefits are denied by the Air Force Personnel or Finance Authorities, and/or the 
DFAS.    If  all  or  some  transitional  benefits  are  denied,  a  discharged  or  separated  Service Member‘s family member/dependents may apply for consideration of limited (MTF direct 
care  only)  medical  benefits  under  the  SECDES  program.    Approval  is  not  guaranteed.    If approved, healthcare is specifically limited to medical services necessary to treat injuries or 
illnesses suffered as a direct result of the sponsor‘s abuse.  See Chapter 2, para. 2.19, Abused Family   Members/Dependents,   for   definitive   information   regarding   processing   medical 
sufficiency    letters    to    support    transitional    healthcare    benefits    for    abused    family members/dependents of discharged or separated Service Members. 
4.17.7.1.  Notification or receipt of denial of transitional compensation benefits (from the installation MPS or Finance Office) does not necessitate MTF obligation to automatically 
submit  a  SECDES  application  on  behalf  of  the  abused  family  member(s).    The  MTF  is only   required   to   submit   an   Air   Force   SECDES   application   to   the   SAF/AA   (via 
AFMOA/SGAT intermediary), if requested in writing by one or more family members of the  discharged  Service  Member.    Confirmation  of  this  action  must  be  coordinated  with 
the abused family member dependent(s) or his/her legal guardian(s).  The MTF location responsible for assembling the SECDES package should include the standard application 
package  documentation  identified  in  paragraph  4.18.  and  Attachment  6,  to  include the application  letter  signed  by  MTF  Commander  and  medical  summary  or  statement  that 
clearly identifies the medical illness, injury or condition (related to, or as a consequence of abuse) for which military healthcare is requested.

4.17.8.  Alcohol Rehabilitation.  Alcohol rehabilitation treatment often requires that members of the family support the active duty member receiving treatment at an authorized DoD MTF.  
These  family  members  may  receive  transportation  to  the  treatment  facility  via  aeromedical evacuation  aircraft  at  no  cost  to  them.    However,  these  individuals  must  cover  the  costs  of 
their  transportation  from  their  homes  to  the  pickup  point  that  the  Theater  or  Patient Movement  Requirements  Center  (PMRC)  designates.    The  PMRC  makes  all  reasonable 
attempts to keep ground travel times and distances to a minimum.  Only one individual may receive transportation under this authority, exceptions require approval from HQ AMC/SG or 
designated PMRC. 4.17.9.  Aeromedical  Evaluation  for  Foreign Military  Members.    Foreign  governments  may 
request   Designee   status   for   their   military   members   in   order   to   receive   aeromedical evaluations  at  the  United  States  Air  Force  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine,  Aeromedical 
Consultation  Service  (ACS),  at  Wright  Patterson  AFB,  OH.    The  ACS  is  not  an  MTF.  Medical  care/treatment  is  not  available  at  this  facility.    The  ACS  evaluates,  diagnoses,  and 
provides  aeromedical  recommendations  to  return  aviators  to  flying  status.    The  foreign member‘s embassy must submit a foreign visitor‘s request/application to the Secretary of the 
Air Force  International  Affairs  Disclosure  Division  (SAF/IAPD).    The  office  of  SAF/IAPD will notify the School of Air Space Medicine‘s designated representative who will submit a 
Designee   application   to AFMOA/SGAT.      At   least   60   calendar   days   is   required   for SAF/IAPD and AFMOA/SGAT to process the request.  SAF/IAPD and  AFMOA require at 
least 30 calendar days per agency to process the foreign visitor‘s request PRIOR to the appointment date.  The Foreign Service member‘s Washington DC embassy must include the 
basic SECDES requirements identified in Attachment 6, plus the following information: 4.17.9.1.  Nationality. 
4.17.9.2.  Service affiliation. 4.17.9.3.  Age. 
4.17.9.4.  Aeronautical rating. 4.17.9.5.  Type of aircraft flown and total number of flying hours.

United States.  The SECAF may use this authority for individual designations, on a case-by-case  basis.    Such  a  designation  does  not  create  a  new  category  of  beneficiaries.    Approval 
Authority for these types of requests rests with OUSD/P&R. 4.17.11.1.  Criteria for selection as a SECAF Designee for foreign nationals: 
4.17.11.1.1.  Foreign nationals nominated for Designee status must be Heads of State, Cabinet members (Minister), Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces, or hold equivalent

in a civilian healthcare facility in the United States. 4.17.11.1.3.  The nominee or his government must agree to assume responsibility for 
payment of DoD healthcare services (at the FRR) and, if the individual requested and the Air Force approved the cost of aeromedical evacuation. 
4.17.11.2.  Designation procedures: 4.17.11.2.1.  Foreign governments seeking Designee status will submit requests to the 
State  Department  through  the  mission  chief  of  the  country  involved.    The  request must  contain  the  full  name  and  title  of  the  individual,  an  explanation  of  why  the 
individual  is  critical  to  US  interests,  the  pertinent  medical  information,  the  billing address  individual  or  office,  and  a  certification  that  the  nominee  meets  all  of  the 
necessary criteria. 4.17.11.2.2.  Refer inquiries from foreign embassies in Washington, or other sources 
to the US Chief of Mission in the country concerned. 4.17.11.2.3.  The State Department reviews the request and refers it to the appropriate 
agency Secretary with a recommendation for approval. 4.17.11.2.4.  The  Request  is  submitted  to  the  SECAF  for  review.    If  approved,  the 
Secretary's  office  forwards  it  to  the  Office  of  the  Air  Force  Surgeon  General  for appropriate action. AFMOA/SGAT prepares the request and assigns responsibility for 
moving  the Designee  through  the  Patient  Movement  Requirements  Center  to  the specific overseas or CONUS MTF. 
4.18.  Applying for Air Force Designee Status.  When evaluating a Designee application, MTF Commanders  should  consider  the  availability  of  MTF  capabilities  and  resources.    If  adequate 
capabilities exist, and the applicant does not meet or qualify for any initial or continued sponsor service  affiliation  for  DEERS  enrollment,  eligibility,  and/or  medical  entitlement  identified  in 
AFI  36-3026V1_IP,  then the MTF  Commander should  accept,  review,  and  sign  the application package recommending  whether or not Designee status is warranted.  The package should then 
be  forwarded  to  AFMOA/SGAT  for  processing.    The  MTF  shall  electronically  submit  (via  e-mail encryption) a Secretarial Designee application to AFMOA/SGAT (Health Benefits) no later 
than 30 days prior to expiration of medical benefits or requested Designee start date (using the format  in  Attachment  6).  The  30  day  window  allows  enough  coordination  time  to submit  the 
SECDES application to the SAF/AA for review and approval consideration. 4.18.1.  The application must contain:

4.18.2.  Forward  all  USAF  Secretarial  Designee  requests  electronically  to  AFMOA/SGAT.  Because  designee  applications  may  contain  PHI  or  sensitive  medical  information,  e-mail 
messages  must  ONLY  be  forwarded  to  higher  headquarters  using  government  Common Access Card (CAC) digital signature and encryption protocols.  Simply assigning a document 
password   and   forwarding   the   information   unencrypted   to   higher   headquarters   is   not authorized.  The message must be digitally signed and encrypted IAW HIPAA standards.  No 
exceptions.    If  unable  to  send  an  encrypted  message,  the  package  may  be  mailed  using  a commercial  overnight  express  mail  shipping  company  or  First  Class  USPS  overnight or 
express mail with return receipt or other package tracking option. 4.18.3.  Each  request  is  required  to  be  coordinated  with  an  AFMOA/SGAT  representative.

Command Surgeons, are authorized to reject applications that do not meet the requirements identified in this chapter.  Applications that are denied or rejected by AFMOA officials and 
the  MAJCOM  Command  Surgeon  do  not  need  to  be  routed  through  or  submitted  to  the SAF/AA.  Ensure request packages are accurate, current and contain all necessary supporting 
documentation. 4.18.6.  AFMOA   will   forward   USAF   Secretarial   Designee   requests   via   e-mail   to   the 
SAF/AA. 4.18.7.  The   electronic   Staff   Summary   Sheet   must   contain   (at   a   minimum)   purpose, 
background,  discussion,  options  and  recommendation.    The  discussion  must  include  a justification that specifies which of the criteria in paragraph 4.17 the request is based upon,

4.20.  Operating the Air Force Secretarial Designee Program Overseas.  Command Surgeons at  Headquarters  United  States  Air  Force  Europe  (HQ  USAFE)  and  Headquarters  Pacific  Air 
Forces (HQ PACAF) for their respective theater have the authority to designate individuals for care in overseas military MTFs.  This authority does not extend to authorizing transportation to 
the  CONUS.    MTF  TOPA  staff  will  keep  a  log  of  individuals  designated  under  this  paragraph according to the instructions in this AFI.  In general, MTF Commanders authorize admission to 
an  Air  Force  MTF,  if  space,  facilities,  and  professional  staff  capabilities  are  available.    In  the case  of  foreign  nationals,  the  desired/requested  healthcare  may  be  denied  if  the same  care  is 
available  elsewhere  in  their  country.    Charges  for  foreign  national  care  are  at  the  FRR.    In circumstances  where  it  would  serve  the  best  interest  of  the  overseas  command,  the  MTF 
Commanders may authorize charges at the subsistence rate. 4.20.1.  U.S.  Citizens.    The  Air  Force  tries  to  keep  the  number  of  US  citizens  that  the 
Commander designates under this paragraph to an absolute minimum.  Most US citizens that fall  under  this  paragraph  are  returning  hostages  and  individuals  involved  in prisoner 
exchanges.    There  may  be  some  occasions  when  designating  US  citizens  other  than  those above would be appropriate. 
4.20.2.  Foreign  Nationals.    Commanders  who  use  the  authority  under  this  paragraph  must issue  guidelines  on  medical  care  for nationals  of  foreign  governments.    These  guidelines 
must identify the categories of persons, both military and civilian, who have authorization for medical  care  within  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph.    Individuals,  whom  the  Commander 
designated under this paragraph, must contribute to the advancement of US public interests.  Generally,  only  officials  of  high  national  prominence  are  made  Designees.    Sometimes,  a 
----------------Page (148) Break----------------
  150  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
Commander  grants  Designee  status  when  there  are  special,  unusual,  or  extraordinary circumstances.    The  Air  Force  may  not  provide  care  for  foreign  nationals  with  incurable 
diseases or who require excessive nursing care.  Commanders should seek recommendations from  the  chief  of  the  diplomatic  mission  or  embassy  to  the  country  involved  before 
authorizing care to any foreign national.  The Air Force collects charges for the Designee‘s care locally.  The Commander waives charges on an exception basis only.

Section 4H—Admissions and Dispositions Program Administration 
4.24.  Responsibility for Admission Processing. 4.24.1.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  patient  administration  is  responsible  for  administrative 
needs required for the admission and disposition of patients.  All patients that are admitted to the medical  facility;  Carded  for  Record Only  (CRO);  reported  as  Emergency  Room  Deaths 
(ERD); while as an inpatient, transferred from one inpatient nursing unit to another, while as an  inpatient;  transferred  into  or  from  the  MTF;  discharged,  or  for  which  administrative 
responsibility  is  assumed,  are  processed  through  the  Admissions  &  Dispositions  (A&D) function  of  the medical  facility.    Air Force  MTFs  also  assume  administrative  responsibility 
for service members hospitalized in non-military medical facilities (including CRO, reporting and  processing  for  AD  and/or  RCSMs  who  may  have  died  at  a  civilian  medical  facility  or 
other   non-federal   installation   or   location).   Patients   will   be   registered,   admitted,   and discharged using the current automated CHCS computer system. 
4.25.  Administrative  Admission  &  Disposition  Requirements.  The  A&D  office  will  verify authorized  eligibility  for  healthcare  for  100%  of  inpatient  admissions.    The  admitting  Provider 
initiates  and  signs  AF  Form  560,  Authorization  and  Treatment  Statement.    A&D  clerks  shall complete  remaining  blocks  of  the  AF  Form  560  and  process  the  admission  in  the  current 
automated computer system once the provider digitally signs the admission order.  Use a manual method  or  other  computer  generated  form  to  assign  registration  number  when  the  current 
automated computer system is not available.

4.26.1.  The  MTF  Commander  at  the  nearest  Air  Force  MTF  shall  assume  the  primary administrative  support  responsibility,  (including  appropriate  Service  Member  identification, 
monitoring, ―tracking,‖ clinical secondary support, advice, analysis, and/or consultation) for any ADSM referred to, hospitalized, or admitted to a non-military medical facility.  AFSMs 
admitted  to  non-military civilian medical facilities are referred to as being in an ―Absent Sick‖ or ABS status. 
4.26.2.  If  necessary,  the nearest Air Force MTF shall serve as an information ―conduit‖ between  the  civilian  or  non-military medical facility, the Airman‘s family, and the Service 
Member‘s chain of command. 4.26.3.  Each  MTF  TOPA  function  or  A&D  office  is  responsible  for identifying  and 
―tracking‖ each known Air Force ADSM hospitalized or admitted to a civilian or non-military medical facility.  Established or perceived geographic boundaries, TRICARE Prime 
Service  Areas,  or  other  distance  or  mileage  restrictions  or  arguments,  shall  not  prohibit  an MTF from its obligation to identify, monitor, track, or support a hospitalized Airman unless 
another  Air  Force  MTF,  has,  or  will  assume  primary  administrative  support  responsibility.  Support  obligations  may  extend  hundreds  of  miles  if  no  other  Air  Force  MTF  exists  in  a 
particular region or if no other Air Force MTF has already been identified as having primary administrative support responsibility. 
4.26.4.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  identified  immediately  above  this  paragraph,  the nearest  MTF  will  assume  primary  administrative  support  responsibility  for  all  known  Air 
Force  ADSMs,  regardless  of  type  of  injury  or  illness,  whether  hospitalization  was  planned, scheduled,  resulted  from  emergent,  urgent,  non-emergency,  non-urgent,  battle  or  non-battle 
related circumstances. 4.26.5.  All  known Air  Force  Wounded  Warriors,  will  be  identified,  tracked,  and  supported 
by the nearest Air Force MTF. 
----------------Page (150) Break----------------
  152  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.26.6.  Any  Air  Force  seriously  ill  or  injured  ADSMs  will  be  identified,  tracked,  and supported by the nearest Air Force MTF. 
4.26.7.  All Air Force ADSMs referred from the MTF, to a civilian or non-military medical facility will be monitored and tracked. 
4.26.8.  Minimum Processes Required to Identify, Monitor, and Track, Absent Sick Patients. 4.26.8.1.  Tracking Requirements for Inpatient or Bedded MTFs: 
4.26.8.1.1.  At  a  minimum,  the A&D office  will  use the CHCS  automated computer system to support their identification, monitoring, and tracking, efforts of each known 
Absent  Sick  patient.    Contact  the  CHCS  site  manager  to  obtain  appropriate  security access keys. 
4.26.8.1.2.  Use  an  AF  Form  560,  Authorization  and  Treatment  Statement  to  collect and document as much demographic information as possible.  Since the form is only 
being used to support administrative tracking at this point, a physician is not required to sign the form.  Create a suspense folder to hold any documents received from the 
civilian   medical   facility   or   to   hold   miscellaneous   administrative   documents.  Documents from the suspense folder may be required later for entry into the inpatient 
record.  An inpatient record is required to summarize and permanently document the care provided to the Service Member at the civilian or non-military medical facility. 
4.26.8.1.3.  Record the admission in the CHCS Patient Administration (PAD) module using   the   Admissions,   Discharges,   and   Transfer   (ADT)   secondary   menu   and 
Admissions (ADM) sub-menu.  This menu includes all ―inpatient activity‖ functions including  admission  &  disposition  processing,  inter-ward transfer options, ―remain 
overnight‖ (RON) entries, and admission cancellation options.  Note: Menu  path shortcuts may vary from one MTF to another. 
4.26.8.1.4.  Document   the   Absent   Sick   (ABS)   admission   by   entering   YYYA ABSENT  SICK  Medical  Expenses  and  Performance  Reporting  System  (MEPRS) 
code.    An  inpatient  unit  or  nursing  ward  is  not  required.    Source  of  admission  type should be ABS...however, because current automated system limitations do not allow 
conversion  of  the  Source  of  Admission  type  from  ABS  to  ABI  when  a  Service Member is transferred from a civilian facility to the MTF, the A&D staff should use 
ABI as the Source of Admission type. 4.26.8.1.5.  If  a  decision  to  transfer  the  Service  Member-patient  from  the  civilian  or 
non-military  medical  facility  to  the  MTF  is  authorized,  then  the  MTF  Chief  of  the Medical  Staff  is  responsible  for  identifying  the  admitting  MTF  physician.    The 
Admissions  and  Dispositions office  leaves  the  admission  category  type  as  ABI  and enters the transfer date and time into CHCS.  Maintain the same register number. 
4.26.8.1.6.  If  the  Service  Member-patient  remains  in  the  civilian  or  non-military facility for the duration of inpatient treatment, the MTF A&D office will change the 
admission  category  type  from  ABI  to  ABS.    After  confirming  the  Service  Member-patient  has  been  discharged  from  the  civilian  or  non-military  medical  facility,  then 
discharge the Service Member-patient in CHCS. 
----------------Page (151) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   153  
4.26.8.1.7.  Request a complete summary of the patient‘s treatment from the civilian or  non-military  medical  facility  before  the  patient  is  transferred  to  the MTF  or  after 
the patient has been discharged from the civilian medical facility. 4.26.8.2.  Tracking Requirements for Outpatient or Non-Bedded MTFs: 
4.26.8.2.1.  The  requirement  to  create  an  inpatient  record  and  transmit  a  Standard Data  Inpatient  Record  (SIDR)  to  higher  headquarters  using  the  CHCS  computer 
system is no longer required at outpatient MTFs that: 4.26.8.2.1.1.  Do  not  currently  employ  either  the  necessary  inpatient  coding 
personnel, and, 4.26.8.2.1.2.  Do not  possess  the necessary  supplemental  CHCS  inpatient  coding 
software. 4.26.8.2.2.  Outpatient  or  non-bedded  MTFs  who  employ  at  least  one  experienced 
inpatient  coder  and  possess  the  necessary  supplemental  CHCS  inpatient  coding software are required to use CHCS as their primary mechanism to identify, monitor, 
and track ABS patients. 4.26.8.2.3.  Place  any  medical  documents  received  from  the  civilian  or  non-military 
medical  facility  into  a  secure,  locked  transitory  file within  the office  responsible for providing  or  facilitating  the  majority  of  the  administrative  support  responsibility.  
Upon  discharge  from  the  civilian  medical  facility,  forward  the  documents  to  the ADSM‘s MTF so they may be filed into the outpatient medical record. 
4.26.8.2.4.  Until   the   Air   Force   and/or   the   Military   Health   System   deploys   a standardized  ABS  tracking  solution,  outpatient  MTFs   are  required  to  identify, 
monitor, and track ABS patients using a local mechanism that, if necessary, is capable of providing higher headquarters or the admitted ADSM‘s chain of command with 
minimum  necessary  amount  of information  aka  Sanitized  Healthcare  Information, when required. 
4.26.9.  The  TOPA  or  PA  Flight  Commander  and/or  A&D  department  supervisor  should establish  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  with  local  &  regional  civilian  and  non-
military  medical  facilities  or  provide these  same  medical  facilities  with  written justification of  the  necessity  to  obtain  biographical  and  medical  information  whenever  ADSMs  are 
admitted  to  civilian  or  non-military  medical  facilities.    Special  emphasis  regarding  timely hospital notification, patient condition updates, transfer arrangements, and patient disposition 
expectations should be identified in any agreement. 4.26.9.1.  The TOPA or PA Flight Commander is required to meet with officials of local 
& regional civilian and non-military medical facilities (at least annually) to establish and reinforce sound business relationships and agreements. 
4.26.9.2.  Inform civilian and non-military medical facilities that in accordance with DoD 6025.18–R, the use and disclosure of PHI of individuals who are Armed Forces personnel 
for  activities  may  be  deemed  necessary  by  appropriate  military  command  authorities  to assure the proper execution of the military mission. 
4.26.9.3.  Inform  each  civilian  or  non-military  medical  facility  the  timely  submission  of critical medical information will a) provide the member‘s primary care manager (or other 
----------------Page (152) Break----------------
  154  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
SGH appointed provider) and the member‘s unit commander with information to better ascertain the member‘s fitness for duty, b) provide  continuity  of  care  if,  and,  when  the 
Service Member is stable enough to transfer to an MTF and, c) ultimately better facilitate potential financial reimbursement from the government. 
4.26.10.  The  nearest  MTF  to  the  hospitalized  ADSM  should  recommend  to  the  Service Member that he or she should sign an information release authorization to allow the civilian 
or non-military medical facility to disclose treatment information to the supporting MTF. 4.26.11.  Obtain  full  patient  identification  from  the  civilian  or  non-military  medical  facility 
and promptly notify the ADSM‘s unit commander by telephone with the patient‘s name and location. 
4.26.12.  When possible, obtain comprehensive medical information regarding the ADSM‘s condition.  The civilian medical or non-military medical facility is financially reimbursed for 
the patient‘s care based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG).  A complete summary of the patient‘s treatment, while under the care of the civilian healthcare provider is required after 
the patient has been discharged. 4.26.13.  If  contacted  by  the  TRICARE  Managed  Care  Support  Contractor,  TRICARE 
Regional Office, the civilian or non-military medical facility, an ADSM family member, unit commander,  or  if  information is known or communicated to MMSO, about an ADSM‘s 
civilian  or  non-military  facility  hospitalization,  before  the nearest  Air  Force  MTF  is  aware, Air Force POCs at MMSO should contact the MTF located nearest to the ADSM‘s location, 
so the MTF may assume administrative support responsibility. 4.26.14.  Prepare  AF  Form  1488,  if  applicable,  and  forward  to  the  Resource  Management 
Flight. 4.26.15.  Prepare AF Form 348, if applicable.  See AFI 36-2910. 
4.26.16.  When  hospitalized  at  a  uniformed  services  treatment  facility  (USTF)  or  VA hospital,  the  nearest  MTF  to  the  USTF  or  VA  medical  facility  assumed  administrative 
support responsibility and will arrange for a transfer to an MTF when the patient is stable and it is safe to transport the Service Member. 
4.26.17.  If  the  Service  Member  is  referred  to  a  USTF  or  VA  hospital,  the  referral  MTF maintains administrative support responsibility. 
4.26.18.  When known, unit commanders of hospitalized: 4.26.18.1.  Reserve  Component  members  (related  to  an  In-Line-of-Duty  occurrence  or 
incident), 4.26.18.2.  Active Duty Service Members assigned to geographically separated units, 
4.26.18.3.  TRICARE  Prime  Remote  ADSMs,  must  notify  the  nearest  Air  Force  MTF and the MMSO, Great Lakes, Il at 1-888-647-6676 as soon as possible when one of their 
members is hospitalized in a civilian or non-military medical facility. 4.26.19.  Notify the base ground safety office in accident cases using AF Form 1488. 
4.27.  Assuming  Administrative  Responsibility  for  Active  Duty  U.  S.  Air  Force  Members Hospitalized in Army or Navy MTFs. 
----------------Page (153) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   155  
4.27.1.  The  nearest  Air  Force  MTF  Commander  assumes  administrative  responsibility  and ensures that the following procedures are carried out for Air Force personnel hospitalized in 
Army or Navy MTFs: 4.27.1.1.  Facilitates necessary communication between member‘s unit commander, and 
officials at the Army or Navy MTF. 4.27.1.2.  Keeps rosters and pertinent data on hospitalized Air Force patients and notifies 
the member‘s unit commander immediately upon notification. 4.27.1.3.  Prepares AF Form 348, when applicable, in accordance with AFI 36-2910. 
4.27.1.4.  See  Section  4I,  Casualty  Reporting  Program  Administration,  for  Seriously  Ill and/or death cases. 
4.27.1.5.  Notifies the base ground safety officer in accident cases. 4.27.1.6.  Within  the  CONUS,  patients  may  be  administratively  assigned  or  attached  to 
the closest Air Force MTF Patient Squadron nearest to the Army or Navy MTF providing medical care.  The decision to permanently assign a patient to the closest AF MTF Patient 
Squadron versus keeping the member‘s current duty assignment location is based, in part, on  the  Service  Member‘s wishes.  However, final assignment approval rests with the 
closest MTF Commander based on the clinical evaluation by the member‘s military provider(s) responsible for the patient‘s overall case management.  Ideally, if there is a 
reasonable  expectation that  the  member  could  be  returned  to  duty  at  his  home  unit,  the aforementioned officials shall be expected to render a decision that supports the patient‘s 
emotional and physiological status, during medical treatment, without regard to whether or not the patient‘s home unit requests or recommends that the patient be removed from 
their  unit  personnel  assignment  register.    AFPC/DPAMM  retains  the  final  authority  to direct Patient Squadron assignments when the involved parties are unable to come to an 
agreement. 4.27.1.7.  Prepares  AF  Form  1488  when  applicable  and  forwards  it  to  the  Resource 
Management Flight. 4.27.1.8.  Serves  as  the  admitted  member‘s  local  representative  for  all  patient 
administration related matters. 4.27.1.9.  All disclosures of PHI to commanders will be tracked in accordance with DoD

4.28.1.  Infants born outside the MTF (e.g., at home or enroute to the hospital) are admitted to the MTF as ―Liveborn‖ or ―Newborn‖ when the mother is also admitted for post-partum 
care within 24 hours following delivery.  If the infant is admitted outside the 24 hour window or if the mother is not admitted at the same time as the infant, then the infant is admitted as a 
Direct admission. 4.28.2.  If the infant‘s birth and subsequent admission first occurred in a civilian hospital and 
the  mother  and  baby  are  later  transferred  to  an  MTF,  admit  the  infant  in  CHCS  using  the CIV-INITIAL ADM TO NON-US MILITARY HOSP, MOVED TO MIL MTF (NON AD)

temporary administrative support responsibility.  In this event, TOPA personnel at the nearest Air  Force  MTF  shall  initiate  the  necessary  action  to  keep  the  designated  parent  service 
representative and member‘s unit commander informed of the patient‘s status. 4.37.3.  Coast  Guard,  US  Public  Health  Service  or  foreign  military  personnel  admitted  to 
civilian  or  non-military  medical  facilities are not admitted and/or tracked as ―Absent Sick‖ and  are  not  entered  into  the  current  automated  inpatient  admission  system.    Additionally, 
there is no need to contact the MAJCOM Command Surgeon‘s Office, AFMOA Health Benefits,  or  the  Air  Force  Medical  Operations  Center  at  the  Pentagon  unless  the  admitted 
Coast Guard, US Public Service or foreign military member meets the ―prominent persons‖ definition listed in paragraph 4.29. 
4.37.4.  In  any  situation  where  the  MTF  receives  information  about any  Uniformed  Service Member  admitted  to  a  local  or  regional  civilian  or  non-military  medical  facility,  it  is 
imperative that the MTF Commander or his/her designee notify the nearest appropriate sister service  MTF  and/or  member‘s  unit  commander,  first  sergeant,  or  other  appropriately 
appointed commander‘s designee, of the hospitalization. 4.37.5.  Notify the base ground safety office in accident cases using AF Form 1488. 
Section 4I—Casualty Reporting Program Administration 
4.38.  Reporting Patients in Casualty Status. 4.38.1.  This section describes patients and MTF reporting procedures for patients placed in a 
casualty  status  IAW  DoDI  1300.18,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Personnel  Casualty Matters,  Policies,  and  Procedures  and  AFI  36-3002,  Casualty  Services.    Categories  of 
patients requiring special casualty reports are as follows: 4.38.1.1.  Very  Seriously  Ill/Injured  (VSI)  Patients.    A  VSI  patient  requires  medical 
attention  and  medical  authority  declares  it  more likely  than  not  that  death  will  occur within 72 hours. 
4.38.1.2.  Seriously  Ill/Injured  (SI)  Patients.    A  SI  patient  requires  medical  attention, medical  authority  declares  that  death  is  possible,  but  not  likely  within  72  hours,  and/or 
the severity is such that it is permanent and life-altering. 4.38.1.3.  Under this section, all disclosures of PHI to commanders will be documented in 
accordance with DoD 6025.18-R.  Disclosure of PHI associated with the SI-VSI status of NON-Active  duty  patients  to  external  MTF  agencies  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  the 
installation  command  post  or  Casualty  Affairs  office)  is  authorized  only  after  obtaining the patient's consent.  In situations where the patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable 
to  agree  or object  to  the  disclosure,  the  MTF  may,  in  the  exercise  of  professional judgment,  make  such  notification  in  accordance  with  DoD  6025.18-R,  C6.2.1.2.    All 
disclosures  of  PHI  must  be  properly  documented  in  the  PHIMT  or  MTF  disclosure accounting tool.

4.39.  Assigning Responsibility. 4.39.1.  The patient‘s attending healthcare provider classifies a patient as VSI or SI and 
records an entry on the AF Form 3066, Doctor‘s Orders, 3066-1, Doctor‘s Orders, or in Essentris.    The  provider  is  also  responsible  for  completing  the  clinical  condition/status 
portions  of  the  AF  Form  570,  Notification  of  Patients  Medical  Status,  and  sign  and  apply signature   stamp   where   required.      Additionally,   MTF   patient   Administration   staff   or 
designated Casualty Affairs Liaison (CAL), may be required (depending on local installation Casualty  Affairs  Office  reporting  rules)  to  complete  an  additional  local  form  to  secure 
emergency  government  sponsored  travel  for  an  active  duty  patient's  immediate  family member(s).  The  MTF  CAL  is  responsible  for  submitting  all  MTF  Casualty  reporting 
forms/documents/information  to  the  installation  Casualty  Affairs  or  Casualty  Assistance Representative  (CAR).   At  inpatient  MTFs,  the  CAL  is  usually  the A&D  office  supervisor, 
one or more members of the A&D staff, and/or the on-call administrative NCO or Officer of the Day.  At outpatient MTFs, the CAL is usually the NCOIC, Patient Administration. 
4.39.1.1.  Preparation of AF Form 570, Notification of Patients medical Status. 4.39.1.1.1.  Complete  sections  I,  II,  and,  III  when  the  report  is  prepared.    Complete 
section IV when reporting SI and VSI patients.  If the patient is an organ donor, check the  appropriate  block  and  indicate  organ  to  be  donated.    The  CAL  will  complete 
section  V.  Section  VI  may  be  used to  continue  entries  from  other  sections,  provide additional information, or request administrative action. 
4.39.1.1.2.  Upon  receiving  the  AF  Form  570,  the  CAL  completes  section  V  and immediately  notifies  the  installation  Commander  via  the  command  post  and/or 
Casualty  Assistance  Representative  (CAR)  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-3002.    The CAL provides enough information to make the first notification and required progress 
reports on the patient‘s status.  If the patient has not authorized  the  release  of  their information,  ensure  only  the  minimum  necessary  amount  of  information  is  released 
and properly documented in the PHIMT or MTF disclosure accounting tool. 4.39.2.  For  active  duty  personnel  in  a  SI,  VSI,  or  Not  Seriously  Ill/Injured  (NSI)  casualty 
status, the attending physician, MTF Commander, member‘s Commander, or designated representative   or   HQ   AFPC/DPWCS   notifies   the   NOK   IAW   AFI   36-3002,   Casualty 
Services. 4.39.3.  When  the  physician  or  dentist  determines that  the  status  of  a  patient  previously 
reported as SI or VSI changes, an AF Form 570 is prepared. 4.39.4.  Regardless of the patient category, document all notifications for SI and VSI status in 
the  appropriate  casualty  status  remarks  module/section  in  the  CHCS  or  other  automated inpatient monitoring and documentation system.  The patient must be admitted and an active 
inpatient register number must exist before casualty status changes can be made.  To record a status change in the CHCS, a) enter the Patient Affairs/Administration (PAD) menu, b) then 
choose the ADT menu, c) next, select the Casualty Status (CS) option, d) enter the start time and post the appropriate status: SI or VSI, or other.  Likewise, when notified of a patient‘s 
removal  from  the  SI  or  VSI  List,  access  the  ADT - CS  menus,  enter  the  stop  time,  and remove the status.  Inform the Casualty Affairs Representative (CAR) and member‘s unit 
Commander  or  installation  command  post.    Contact  your  CHCS  site  manager  to  obtain 
----------------Page (163) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   165  
appropriate security access keys.  For non-active duty patient, seek patient permission before releasing casualty reporting information.  Document the release of information (for all patient 
categories) in the PHIMT or MTF disclosure accounting tool. 4.39.5.  Absent Sick Patients:  The Chief of the Medical Services (SGH), his/her designee, or 
other  appropriate  medical  authority  at  the  MTF  assigned  to  monitor  the  civilian  medical facility  admission,  should  contact  the  member‘s  attending  physician  and  obtain  enough 
medical  information  to  determine  appropriate  SI  or  VSI  status  (if  warranted).    If  such  a condition exists, an AF Form 570 must be completed by the physician and forwarded to the 
office  responsible  for  coordinating  with  the  CAR  and  member‘s  unit  Commander  or installation command post.  If the patient has not authorized the release of their information, 
ensure  only  the  minimum  necessary  amount   of  information  is  released  and  properly documented in the PHIMT or MTF disclosure accounting tool. 
4.40.  Requesting  and  Arranging  Travel  for  Next  of  Kin  (NOK)  under  the  Emergency Family Member Travel (EFMT) Program. 
4.40.1.  In situations where an AD or RCSM patient in a ―On Duty‖ and/or ―In-Line of Duty status‖ has been placed on the inpatient SI or VSI  roster,  the  attending  physician  must 
provide written recommendation  to  the MTF  Commander that  indicates  the  presence  of  the designated travelers is considered beneficial to the patient‘s recovery or when the member‘s 
designated travelers‘ presence is warranted given the patient‘s critical or terminal prognosis.  If  the  MTF  Commander  approves  the  request  (in  writing),  the  CAL  or  the  administrative 
officer  or  noncommissioned  officer  of  the  day  must  immediately  contact  the  installation CAR.      The   CAR   is   then responsible  for  coordinating  the  MTF  Commander‘s 
recommendation/approval for EFMT Program with AFPC Casualty Affairs officials.  AFPC Casualty  Affairs  Program  management  officials  are  responsible  for  arranging  military  or 
commercial  transportation  arrangements  (including  commercial  airline  travel)  for  no  more than three designated travelers provided all the required NOK information is obtainable.  A 
comprehensive explanation of the entire EFMT Program is available in AFI 36-3002. 4.40.2.  The   MTF   Commander   or   designee   must   concur   and   approve   the   attending 
physician‘s  request  on  EFMT  Request  Memorandum  prior  to  AFPC  Casualty  Affairs Program securing emergency designated traveler travel arrangements.  Prior to approving the 
EFMT  Request  Memorandum,  the MTF  Commander  or  designee  must  ensure  there  are  no more  than  a  total  of  three  designated  travelers  between  the  EFMT  and  Non-medical 
Attendant Program. 4.40.3.  Final  emergency  designated  traveler  travel  approval  is  not  to  be  authorized  at  the 
MTF. 4.40.4.  The EFMT Program benefit does not apply to Service academy cadets, high school, 
college, or university ROTC participants. 4.41.  Preparing the AF Form 1403, Roster of Seriously Ill Very Seriously Ill. 
4.41.1.  The CAL prepares the AF Form 1403, Roster of Seriously Ill/Very Seriously Ill, just after  midnight  each  day  to  document  the  preceding  24-hour  casualty  status  activity  period.  
Negative activity rosters are not required.  Typically, this report is generated automatically or user requested from the CHCS automated system.  Distribute the report internally within the 
MTF  in  accordance  with  local  guidance.    External  MTF  reporting  should  be  limited  to  the 
----------------Page (164) Break----------------
  166  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
installation  Casualty  Affairs  office  and/or  the  installation  Command Post  (in  case  of  VIP reporting).    Report  initial  SI/VSI  placement  status  and  again  if  the  status  changes  or  is 
removed.    Reporting  SI  and  VSI  status  PHI  to  external  MTF  agencies  (including,  but  not limited  to,  the  installation  command  post  or  casualty  affairs  office)  regarding  non-Active 
Duty Service Members, is generally authorized only after obtaining the patient‘s consent or obtaining consent from the patient‘s parent or legal guardian.  If permission is obtained or 
release  is  deemed  necessary  by  the  attending  physician  to  secure  emergency  government sponsored  travel  for  an  active  duty  patient's  immediate  family  member(s),  document  the 
release  with  the  appropriate  facility  HIPAA  official(s)  and/or  standard  disclosure  tracking mechanism. 
4.41.2.  Providing  Follow-up  Information.      The  CAL  provides  the  installation  Commander and CAR with information received from the patient‘s healthcare provider for follow-up 
action in accordance with AFI 36-3002. 4.41.3.  Removing Patients from the Roster. 
4.41.3.1.  When  the  attending  healthcare  provider  determines  that  the  patient  can  be removed  from  the  Roster  of  Seriously  Ill/Very  Seriously  Ill  prepare  AF  Form  570  and 
send it to the CAL. 4.41.3.2.  The CAL will notify the installation Commander and CAR once the patient is 
removed  from  the  roster  so  that  action  can  be  taken  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-3002, Casualty  Services.    Notify  interested  persons  or  agencies,  as  defined  by  local  guidance, 
quickly  and  complete  Section  V  of  AF  Form  570.  File AF Form 570 in the patient‘s suspense  file.    Annotate  the  remarks  section  of  the  work  copy  of  the  AF  Form  1403  to 
indicate the time of removal. 4.42.  Responsibility for Preparing Death Cases. 
4.42.1.  Death  of  a  person  while  being attended  outside  the  MTF:  The  attending  Air  Force medical officer. 
4.42.2.  Death  of  a  person  in  an  Air  Force-owned  or  leased  aircraft:  The  medical  treatment unit serving the base that investigated the accident. 
4.42.3.  Death of other Air Force personnel who are not patients in an MTF at time of death:  The MTF serving the base that investigated the circumstances of death. 
4.42.4.  Death of a non-military person on an Air Force base:  The MTF serving the base. 4.42.5.  Death of  a  person  being  staged  through  an  aeromedical  staging  flight  (ASF):    The 
MTF supporting the ASF. 4.42.6.  Death  of  a  person  while  in  transit  and  in  inpatient  status:    The  MTF  receiving  the 
remains.   Note:  Treat  as  transfer-in  patients  those  who  die while in transit  (either while in flight or in an ambulance between facilities) or while being staged through an ASF. 
4.42.7.  Notwithstanding  any  other  international,  federal,  state,  or  county  law,  or  any  other DoD  or  USAF  instruction,  MTF providers, (usually the member‘s PCM or specialist), may 
be asked to sign the death certificates for  retired  military members or family members who have died in their  (off-base) homes of natural causes.  Check with the wing or base mortuary 
----------------Page (165) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   167  
affairs  office, local county sheriff‘s office, or county coroner before preparing the death certificate or authorizing or obtaining an MTF provider‘s signature. 
4.43.  Policies Regarding Deaths. 4.43.1.  See AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, for instructions on preparing, inspecting 
and shipping remains and completing related forms and reports. 4.43.2.  A  healthcare  provider  verifies  all  deaths  occurring  at  an  Air  Force  MTF  and  on  an 
Air Force installation. 4.43.3.  Do  not  remove  the body  without  permission  of  civil  authorities  or  local  coroner, 
when  a  member of  the  Uniformed  Services  on  active  duty  dies  outside  the limits  of  an  Air Force installation. 
4.43.3.1.  The  Commander  consults  with  the  Office  of  the  Armed  Forces  Medical Examiner  (OAFME)  when  uniformed  services  personnel  die  within  installation  limits 
under  exclusive  federal  jurisdiction.    When  uniformed  services  personnel  die  beyond installation limits the Commander consults local civil authorities to identify procedures to 
follow. 4.43.3.2.  Obtain  a  transient  or  burial  permit  from  the  proper  civil  authority  before 
removing a body from an Air Force base for shipment or burial. 4.43.3.3.  Release  remains  to  mortuary  personnel  within  24  hours  after  death unless 
extenuating  circumstances  exist.    Ensure  that  the  death  certificate  is  completed  and signed  by  the  responsible  medical  officer  before  releasing  the  remains.    The  mortuary 
representative (military  or civilian) taking custody of the remains signs  a receipt for the remains.  File the receipt in the deceased‘s inpatient or outpatient record, as appropriate. 
4.43.4.  Initial movement of remains is accomplished as follows: 4.43.4.1.  Typically,  a  provider  pronounces  death  at  the  site  or  at the  MTF;  prepares  a 
death certificate; and obtains a decision regarding an autopsy.  If no autopsy is required, officials from Mortuary  Affairs  are responsible for arranging transportation to move the 
body from the site or from the MTF to the internment location. 4.43.4.1.1.  If an autopsy is required, it must be authorized by the base commander or 
by  the  OAFME.    If  the  local  coroner  has  right  of  first  refusal  (in  accordance  to applicable  state  law)  to  conduct  the  autopsy  and  the  local  coroner  defers  to  the 
Government, the following guidance takes effect: 4.43.4.1.1.1.  For  deaths  occurring  on  a  military  installation,  or  under  federal 
jurisdiction,  if  the  MTF  on  that  installation  has  the  capability  and  capacity  to perform the autopsy, then the MTF is responsible for performing the autopsy.  If 
the  installation  MTF  does  not  have  the  capability  or  capacity  to  perform  the autopsy  then  the  installation  Mortuary  Affairs  office  is  responsible  for  either 
arranging  transportation  of  the  body  to  another  MTF  where  autopsy  capabilities exist   or   arranging   a   post-mortem   examination   with   a   contracted   civilian 
pathologist. 4.43.4.1.1.2.  If the death of an Air Force Active Duty Service Member occurs outside 
a  military  installation,  the  nearest  Air  Force  installation  Mortuary  Affairs  office  is 
----------------Page (166) Break----------------
  168  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
responsible  for  arranging  transportation  of  the  body  from  the  death  site  or  local coroner‘s office back to the closest MTF with histopathology-autopsy capabilities or 
to a contracted civilian pathologist in accordance with local and Air Force Mortuary Affairs policy.  In accordance with AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, 
paragraph 10.25.10.2., autopsies performed by civilian pathologists, not employed by the  Air  Force,  are  funded  using  ―O&M  funds  of  the organization  to  which  the 
deceased was assigned.‖ 4.43.4.1.2.  If an autopsy is required and the local coroner is authorized right of first 
refusal (in accordance to applicable state law) to conduct the autopsy and the coroner decides  to  conduct  the  autopsy  themselves,  officials  from  Mortuary  Affairs  are 
responsible for arranging transportation to move the body to the coroner and then to internment  location.    Refer  to  AFI  34-242  for  more  information  regarding  available 
post-mortem Mortuary Affairs responsibilities and services. 4.43.4.2.  Local  civil  authorities,  namely  the  local  coroner,  exercise  control  over  the 
movement  of  remains  in  the  event  of  an  off-installation  death.    Once  the  remains  of  an active  duty  member  are  released  from  the  civil  authorities,  determine  if  an  autopsy  will 
be  performed.    If  yes,  medical  personnel  provide  or  arrange  transport  of  the  remains  to the MTF.   If an autopsy is not required, mortuary  services transports the remains to the 
contract funeral home or government mortuary.  Note:  In the event of a military aircraft accident, an autopsy is usually required and will be funded with DHP money regardless 
of who performs the examination. 4.43.4.2.1.  For   overseas   locations   the   same   procedures   identified   in paragraph 
4.43.4.2. may be used for family members and other eligible beneficiaries. 4.43.4.2.2.  In a disaster or multiple death situation everyone available assists in any 
way  possible.    The  mortuary  officer  calls  the  motor  pool  for  transportation  to  move the remains during search and recovery operations.  Remains are placed in body bags 
for movement. 4.43.5.  When a patient dies, notify the CAL or their representative immediately. 
4.43.6.  Collect  and  inventory  all  personal  property  of  the  deceased  in  the  presence  of  a witness  as  soon  as  possible  following  the  death  of  any  patient.    Send  personal  effects  of  a 
military  patient  to  the  summary  court  officer.    Send  personal  effects  of  civilians  to  an executor  or  administrator,  or  (if  none  appointed)  to  the  nearest  NOK.    The  executor, 
administrator  or  nearest  NOK,  as  appropriate,  signs  the  inventory  as  a  receipt  for  effects.  File the receipt in the patient‘s inpatient or outpatient record, as appropriate. 
4.43.7.  Certificate  of Death.    Usually  the  provider  pronouncing  death,  or  other  authorized personnel, prepares a death certificate and sends it to the proper authorities according to state 
and  civil  requirements.    However,  the  death  certificate  must  be  signed  by  a  physician  with knowledge of the primary and contributory cause(s) of death.  This may be the pronouncing 
physician, the deceased‘s primary physician, or another member of the medical staff with that knowledge.   File one copy of the certificate in the deceased patient‘s  inpatient  health 
record  or  extended  ambulatory  record.    In  overseas  locations,  prepare  DD  Form  2064, Certificate of Death (Overseas), per AFI 34-242. 
----------------Page (167) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   169  
4.43.8.  Reporting Deaths.  The MTF Commander reports deaths as required by AFI 36-3002 when a person dies at an Air Force MTF or en route to the MTF.  Establish local procedures 
regarding other required notifications. 4.43.9.  Reporting Stillbirths.  Prepare a certificate of death and file it as required by state and 
civil  law.    File  one  copy of the fetal death certificate with the mother‘s inpatient record. In the  case  of  an  abortion,  send  the  surgical  specimen  to  the  laboratory  the  same  as  for  other 
surgical specimens.  Note:  Even when not required by state law, a fetal death certificate may be issued if the NOK requests the coroner or medical examiner to do so. 
4.43.10.  Comply  with  AFI  34-242  when  deceased,  uniformed services  personnel  cannot  be identified  by  local  means.    Utilize  the  resources  of  the  OAFME  to  the  maximum  extent 
possible to support the identification of remains. 4.44.  Performing Post Mortem (Autopsy) - Non-Forensic Cases. 
4.44.1.  For hospital/non-forensic autopsies,  file the authorization to perform a post mortem examination in the deceased‘s inpatient or outpatient record, as appropriate.  Perform a post 
mortem only with the consent of the surviving spouse, NOK, person(s) having right of burial, or  at  the  request  of  the  local  coroner  or  medical  examiner  except  in  the  circumstances 
described in paragraph 4.60.5. 4.44.2.  Under  normal  circumstances,  complete  the  post  mortem  within  24  hours  after  the 
remains are received, appropriate records are available and authorization has been granted. 4.44.3.  Record the post mortem on SF 503, Medical Record-Autopsy Protocol.  Except those 
performed  under  AFI  91-204.    File  the  original  copy  with  either  the  inpatient  record  or Extended Ambulatory Record of the deceased.  Maintain a completed copy of the certificate 
in the clinical laboratory. 4.44.4.  A death, military or civilian, is a medical examiner case subject to forensic autopsy 
when  it  meets  the  criteria  listed  under  DoDI  5154.30,  Armed  Forces  Institute  of  Pathology Operations, enclosure 2, paragraph E2.2.  These cases do not require consent from the next of 
kin.  If the death meets any one of the criteria listed in either of these regulations, it must be referred to the OAFME.  The OAFME may be contacted 24 hours a day, seven days a week 
at commercial 301-319-0000. 4.44.5.  Authorization   for   Post   Mortem   on   US   Uniformed   Services   Personnel.      The 
installation  Commander  or  Armed  Forces  Medical  Examiner  (AFME)  is  the  approving authority for the post mortem examinations in areas exclusive to Federal jurisdiction and in 
other areas when the civil authority has released  jurisdiction to the Uniformed Services.   In areas outside the US and its Territories, existing Status of Forces Agreements apply.  When 
the  host  government  relinquishes  its  authority,  the  AFME  or  installation  Commander authorizes  the  post  mortem.    This  approving  authority  may  be  delegated  to  the  MTF 
Commander, but must be written and always current. 4.44.6.  Performing a Post Mortem Examination on a Civilian. 
4.44.6.1.  Obtain  the  written,  signed  permission  of  the  nearest  NOK,  or  an  order  by  an appropriate  civil  or  military  authority  if  the  death  occurred  in  unusual  or  suspicious 
circumstances.    Develop  procedures  incorporating  the  requirements  of  this  instruction, 
----------------Page (168) Break----------------
  170  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
relevant  laws,  existing  legal  agreements  and  other  legitimate  requirements  of  local authorities. 
4.44.6.2.  For  post  mortem  purposes,  treat  as  civilians  the  remains  of  members  of  the National Guard, Reserve Officers Training Corps and other Reserve Components not on 
active duty for training. 4.44.6.3.  When  consent  of  NOK is  required,  check  to  verify  notification  and  obtain  the 
required consent on SF 523, Medical Record-Authorization for Autopsy. 4.44.6.4.  After deliverance of casualty notice to the family or NOK and confirmation of 
its  receipt,  the  MTF  Commander  sends  a  condolence  letter  to  the  family  or  NOK  and requests permission for a post mortem.  The consent is filed in the patient‘s inpatient or 
outpatient record, as appropriate. 4.44.6.5.  At overseas installations, request the family or NOK send the reply to  request 
for  post  mortem  consent  to  AFMOA/SGH.    Upon  receipt  of  reply,  AFMOA/SGH  will send a priority wire through military message channels advising of the decision and then 
send  the  original  message by mail to the MTF for filing in the patient‘s inpatient or outpatient record, as appropriate. 
4.44.7.  Performing  a  Post  Mortem  examination  on  Foreign  Military  Personnel.    Obtain permission  for  post  mortem  examination  from  the  military  attaché  of the  foreign  embassy.  
Include this request for permission in the casualty report required by AFI 36-3002. 4.44.8.  Organ  Disposal  Following  Post  Mortem.    Return  all  organs  and  tissues  removed 
during  post  mortem  to  the  body,  except  those  organs,  tissues  and  tissue  fluids  essential  to diagnose  the  cause  of  death  or  intended  for  studies  authorized  by  the  family  or  NOK  or 
required by law (see DoDD 6465.2). 4.45.  Disposition  of  Outpatient  Records  on  Deceased  Active  Duty  Personnel.  See AFI 36-
2608, Military Personnel Records System  and AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services for guidance on the disposition of the outpatient record when an active duty member of the US Armed Services 
expires. 4.46.  Deceased Patient Kit. 
4.46.1.  Although local or state government jurisdictional law may require the local medical examiner  or  coroner  to  respond,  manage,  review  or  pronounce  death  for  each  fatality  that 
occurs on  a military installation, sometimes this responsibility is deferred to the installation MTF, especially when no suspicious circumstances exist that require an investigation by the 
local   medical   examiner/coroner   or   when   the   MTF   has   histopathology/post-mortem examination  capability.    When  practical  and  only  when  approved  by  the  appropriate 
installation  Plans,  Programs,  and  Operations  officials,  the  MTF  may  enter  into  a  support agreement with the local medical examiner or coroner and the installation Mortuary Affairs 
office.  Any agreement should identify specific forms and instructions necessary to process a deceased  body.    To  adequately  prepare  for  any  contingency,  each  non-bedded  Air  Force 
MTF  is  required  to  compile  and  maintain  at  least  FIVE  pre-positioned  death  processing packages.    Each  package  will  contain  all  of  the  forms  and  documents  (described  below).  
When the MTF is required or authorized to officially respond and process a human being‘s death occurring on a military installation, each package will be used to document the fatality 
----------------Page (169) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   171  
whether  the  death  occurred  in  the  MTF  or  elsewhere  on  the  military  installation.    Inpatient MTFs will maintain a minimum of TEN packages.  The packages should be kept in a central 
location such as the TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration Flight, admissions and dispositions office, or the emergency department.  Each package shall contain, at a minimum, 
the following forms in the specified quantities: 4.46.1.1.  SF Form 523. 
4.46.1.2.  AF Form 146, Death Tag. 4.46.1.3.  AF Form 570. 
4.46.1.4.  Release of Remains. 4.46.1.5.  Request for Postmortem Examination. 
4.46.1.6.  AF Form 1122, Personal Property and Effects Inventory. 4.46.1.7.  Fax Notification. 
4.46.1.8.  Death Certificate Worksheet. 4.46.1.9.  Death Certificate (Issued by state. If overseas use DD Form 2064). 
Section 4J—Birth Registration Program Administration 
4.47.  Birth Registration in the CONUS. 4.47.1.  A birth certificate will be prepared for each infant born in an Air Force MTF.  Follow 
State laws with regard to the forms used, format, and number of copies required.  File a work copy in the infant‘s inpatient record.  Contact local department of Vital Statistics to obtain a 
copy of birth certificate. 4.47.2.  Updating  Personnel  Records.    Advise  parents  to  report  to  the  MPS  to  update 
personnel records and register the child in DEERS as part of birth registration.  This must be accomplished  within  120  days  or  the  member  will  receive  a  bill  for  care.    When  both  the 
parents are active duty, recommend that the same sponsor be identified in CHCS and DEERS in  order to  eliminate confusion  with  the records.    See  further sponsor  service  affiliation  for 
DEERS enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement in AFI 36-3026V1_IP. 4.47.3.  Refer  parents  to  the  TRICARE  Service  Center  for  TRICARE  options,  including 
TRICARE Prime enrollment. 4.48.  Registering Births Overseas. 
4.48.1.  Overseas Air Force MTFs must cooperate with consular officers in registering births of infants born to US citizens in areas overseas.  EXCEPTIONS: Register births in American 
Samoa,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  the  Trust  Territories,  and  the  US  Virgin  Islands  through  the special  offices  of  the  Vital  Statistics  Division,  Public  Health  Services,  US  Department  of 
Health and Human Services, or specified local US Government offices.  See further sponsor service  affiliation  for  DEERS  enrollment,  eligibility,  and  medical  entitlement  in  AFI  36-
3026V1_IP. 4.48.2.  Reporting  Births.    Births  are  reported  to  local  authorities  on  the  forms  provided  by 
US Consular Offices. 
----------------Page (170) Break----------------
  172  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.48.3.  Notifying  the  US  Consular  Office.    Notify  the  US  Consular  Office  where  the  Air Force  MTF  is  located  no  later  than  10  days  after  the  birth  of  an  infant  whose  parent  or 
parents are US citizens. 4.48.4.  Completing  Department  of  State  Foreign  Forms  FS-240,  Consular  Report  of  Birth 
Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America.  The form FS-240 will be completed in four  copies.    The  (US  citizen)  parent  will  sign each  copy  of  the  forms  under  oath  before  a 
military  officer qualified  to  administer oaths.   The  officer administering  the  oath  completes the section reading, ―This section to be completed by consular officer, notary public or other 
person  qualified  to  administer oaths‖ Note:  Obtain  a  supply  of  form  FS-240s  from  the nearest US Consular Office. 
4.48.5.  If the mother is not a US citizen, the US citizen father must sign form FS-240 if he is available.    If  the  father  is  not  available  (or  if  there  is any  question  about  his  citizenship 
status), ask the parent(s) to get in touch with the US Consular Office. 4.48.6.  If the mother dies or is in very serious condition and the father, who is a US citizen, 
is  not  available, send  the  form  FS-240  to  the  US  Consular Office  as  soon  as  the healthcare provider delivering the infant signs the form to attest the delivery. 
4.48.7.  Contact the nearest US Consular Office concerning necessary procedures to establish US citizenship when a child is born out of wedlock. 
4.48.8.  Advise the parents about the following procedures: 4.48.8.1.  If  the  US  citizen  parents  have  the  proper  documentation  to  support  entries  on 
form FS-240, inform them that they need not go to the US Consular Office in person. 4.48.8.2.  If the necessary  documentation is questionable or not available, send the form 
FS-240  to  the  US  Consular  Office  and  advise  the  parents  to  visit  the  office  with documents establishing marriage and citizenship. 
4.48.8.3.  In  addition  to  proving  birth  fact,  the  US  Consular  approved  form  FS-240  is considered  full  proof  of  US  citizenship  in  all  courts,  tribunals  and  public  offices  of  the 
US  both  inside  and  outside  the  CONUS;  the  District  of  Columbia;  and  each  state, territory, and outlying possession of the US.  The form FS-240 is equal to the certificate 
of  citizenship  or  naturalization  that  the  US  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service (USINS) issues. 
4.48.8.4.  FS-545, Certificate of Birth, (also known as form DS-1350 in the US).  Obtain information from the form FS-240 to prepare the Certification of Birth.  This certification 
is a short form record of birth that the Department of State uses to provide persons born outside the CONUS and its possessions with a birth certificate form similar to those that 
State Vital Statistics Registration Offices in the US issue.  However, this Certification of Birth does not replace the form FS-240 in any way. 
4.48.9.  Registration  of  Birth.    Advise  the  parents  that  a  fee  for registering the child‘s birth will be charged.  The US Consular Officer issues them a copy of the form FS-240 when the 
birth is reported, as well as a copy of the form FS-545. 4.48.10.  Additional Copies of forms FS-240 and FS-545 (or form DS-1350).  Parents, or the 
child at a later date, can obtain additional copies of the forms FS-240 and FS-545 (form DS-1350) from the Vital Records Section, Passport Services, 1111 19th Street, N.W., Suite 510,

Washington, DC 20522-1705.  The State Department‘s web site has information on how to make the request, what information to include, and payment of associated fees.  The web site 
address is http://www.travel.state.gov/law/family_issues/birth/birth_593.html. 4.48.11.  Updating  Personnel  Records.    Advise  DOD  personnel  whose  children  are  born 
overseas to report to the MPS to update personnel records  and register the child in  DEERS and passport application as part of birth registration in an overseas area. 
Section 4K—Medical Evaluation of SMs for Continued Military Service 
4.49.  Purpose and Program Introduction. 4.49.1.  In order to maintain a fit and vital force, the SECAF relies on statutory authorization 
(10 U.S.C., Chapter 61) to remove Service Members (SMs) from the Air Force who can no longer perform their military duties because of a mental or physical defect.  If a SM‘s 
identified medical diagnosis, condition or physical or mental limitation prohibits or limits the individual from completing his or her duties and/or routinely interferes with his or her ability 
to   obtain   complete   individual   deployment   readiness   or   worldwide   duty   reassignment qualification, and/or imposes unreasonable requirements on the military to either maintain or 
protect the member, the SM may be separated, discharged or retired from military Service. 4.49.2.  A SM‘s medical diagnosis, condition, physical or mental limitation may also be 
considered  a  medical  disability.    SMs  identified  with  a  potential  Service-disqualifying medical  diagnosis,  condition,  physical  or  mental  limitation  will  be  evaluated,  and  when 
indicated, referred through the Disability Evaluation System (DES). 4.50.  Eligibility for Disability Evaluation Processing. 
4.50.1.  Active Duty SMs who are not on ―Excess Leave‖ status, unless the status is granted in order to participate in an educational program or for emergency purposes, are eligible. 
4.50.2.  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  eligibility  is  established  in  IAW  AFI  36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement and Separation, Chapter 8. 
4.50.3.  USAF Academy Cadets are eligible for disability processing according to 10 U.S.C. § 1217. 
4.50.4.  College  or  University  Reserve  Officers‘  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  cadets  are  not authorized entry to the US Air Force Disability Evaluation System. ROTC cadets, who incur 
(while in the line of duty) injury, illness, or death, during official military training, or while traveling  to  or  from  the  location  of  official  military  training,  may  be  entitled  to  disability 
benefits  or  compensation  from  the  Department  of  Labor.    Refer  to  the  Federal  Employees Compensation  Act  or  5  U.S.C.  Part  III,  Chapter  81,  § 8140  for  information  related  to 
disability benefits external to the Air Force or Department of Defense. 4.50.5.  The  following  are  NOT  eligible  for  disability  evaluation  processing  unless  it  is 
clearly  evident  that  a  medical  impairment  and/or  extenuating  circumstance  were  likely  the cause of the conduct: 
4.50.5.1.  SMs pending an approved, unsuspended, punitive discharge or dismissal. 4.50.5.2.  SMs   who   are   pending   separation   under   provisions   that   authorize   a 
characterization  of  service  of  Under  Other  Than  Honorable  (UOTH).  This  restriction  is 
----------------Page (172) Break----------------
  174  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
based on the provisions under which the member is being separated and not on the actual characterization  the  member  receives.  For  example,  because  separation  for  misconduct 
authorizes  a  UOTH,  a  member  who  is being  separated  for  misconduct  with  a  general characterization is ineligible for disability processing. 
4.50.5.3.  SMs  facing  court  martial  charges  are  not  eligible  for  disability  processing unless  there  is  a  question  of  mental  capacity  or  responsibility or when the member‘s 
sentence  of  dismissal  or  punitive  discharge  is  suspended.  Refer  to  AFI  36-3212  for additional information regarding eligibility for disability evaluation consideration. 
4.50.5.4.  SMs in an Absent Without Leave (AWOL) status, in ―Deserter‖ status, or those who  have  been  apprehended  or  arrested  and  are  in  police  custody,  are  not  eligible  for 
disability  processing  until  the  SM  returns  to  military  custody  and  only  after  HQ AFPC/DPSD determines eligibility for disability processing. 
4.50.5.5.  Air Force SMs sentenced to Service dismissal or punitive discharge by a court martial,  or  those  who  have  been  formally  charged  with  a  crime,  are  not  eligible  for 
disability  evaluation  processing.    Medical  Hold  is  not  authorized  unless  court  martial sentences  are  suspended,  or  court  martial  charges  are  dropped  to  permit  separation  or 
retirement  in  lieu  of  court  martial,  or  charges  are  held  in  abeyance  pending  a  sanity determination.    Refer  to  AFI  36-3212,  for  further  information  regarding  eligibility  for 
PEB consideration. 4.50.6.  Sometimes, SMs who are pending involuntary separation or discharge are eligible for 
DES processing. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) will make the final disposition on these  cases,  which  are termed ―dual-action cases‖ since they are adjudicated under both 
directives.  Refer  to  AFI  36-3212,  Physical  Evaluation  for  Retention,  Retirement,  and Separation,  and  AFI  36-3206,  Administrative  Discharge  Procedures  for  Commissioned 
Officers, for additional information related to DES eligibility consideration. 4.51.  Entrance into the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES). 
4.51.1.  The IDES integrates the Air Force DES with the Veterans Administration (VA), and delivers the advantage of single-sourced disability ratings that are accepted by both the DoD 
and  the  VA,  so  the  member  will  receive  a  VA  benefits  decision  shortly  after  separation  or retirement. 
4.51.1.1.  One  of  the  goals  of  the  DoD  component  services  is  to  carefully  screen  SMs with  potentially  unfitting  conditions,  so  they  are  appropriately  referred  into  the  IDES 
only when a ―return to duty‖ adjudication is not likely. 4.51.1.2.  In  order  to  minimize  inappropriate  referrals  to  the  IDES,  there  will  be  a  two-
step ―pre-IDES‖ screening process on all potential MEB cases.  The first step will be accomplished  by  the  MTF  Deployment  Availability  Working  Group  (DAWG).    The 
second step will be accomplished by HQ AFPC/DPAMM (Medical Retention Standards Branch)  or  the  appropriate  ARC/SGP.    Cases  that  AFPC/DPAMM  (DPAMM)  or 
ARC/SGP  directs  for  MEB  will  be  entered  into  the  IDES  process.      DPAMM  and ARC/SGP may also adjudicate a case as ―Return to Duty‖ (RTD).  An RTD disposition 
by DPAMM or ARC/SGP is final, and has the same effect and authority as an MEB. 
----------------Page (173) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   175  
4.51.1.2.1.  The ―Review-in-Lieu-of‖ (RILO) MEB will be used as the pre-IDES screening  process.    Cases  submitted  for  pre-IDES  screening  will  be  referred  to  as 
―Initial  RILO‖  packages  and  will  contain  a  Narrative  Summary   (NARSUM), associated consult reports and/or studies, a current AF Form 469 (reviewed IAW AFI 
10-203), a commander‘s letter, and a standardized cover sheet checklist (found on the AFPC Medical Retention Standards Branch page of the AFMS Knowledge Exchange 
[go to Headquarters ViewMoreOtherAFPC Medical Retention Standards].)  Note:  A ―Modified RILO‖ can also be used to obtain an expedited case disposition when 
needed (e.g., separation, retirement, pending assignments, pending deployments, etc.) and  does not require a commander‘s letter unless directed by DPAMM.  Modified 
RILOs  are  also  used as  recurring  updates  (e.g.,  Annual  RILO)  for members with  an Assignment  Limitation  Code-C  (ALC-C) and do not require commander‘s letters 
unless requested by DPAMM. 4.51.1.2.2.  Initial  RILO  packages  are  reviewed  by  the  DAWG.    Once  reviewed  by 
the DAWG, the packages are  forwarded to  DPAMM for adjudication.  For RCSMs, refer to 4.52.6. 
4.51.1.3.  If  DPAMM  or  the  appropriate  ARC/SGP  directs  that  an  Initial  RILO  should undergo  an  MEB,  the  SM  formally  enters  the  IDES  as  of  the  date  that  the  referring 
provider  signs  and  dates  the  VA  Form  21-0819  VA/DoD  Joint  Disability  Evaluation Board Claim form.  The provider will provide the form to the Physical Evaluation Board 
Liaison  Officer  (PEBLO)  who  will  then  enter  the  initial  case  information  into  the Veteran‘s Tracking Application (VTA). 
4.52.  Trigger Events that Require Preliminary DAWG Review. 4.52.1.  A trigger event is a condition or occurrence which may indicate a SM has (a) medical 
and/or  mental  health  condition(s)  that  is  (are)  inconsistent  with  retention  standards  or deployability.  After a provider recognizes a trigger event, the provider must notify the MTF 
PEBLO  and  Medical  Standards  Management  Element  (MSME),  so  a  summary  of  the member‘s information can be obtained for preliminary presentation at the next scheduled 
DAWG  meeting.  Each  DAWG  should  establish  procedures  and  guidelines  for  reporting trigger  events  at  its  respective  MTF.    Trigger  events  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the 
following: 4.52.1.1.  (1)  Provider   identification   of   duty   limiting   condition(s)   or   deployment 
limitation(s).  Although not an ―all-inclusive‖ list, Chapter 5 of AFI 48-123  specifies conditions that require evaluation for continued military service.  (During any pre-MEB 
clinical evaluation or ―work-up‖ period, providers will ensure the SM is placed on AAC 31.)      Each   MTF   provider,   after   discovering   a   potential   or   questionable   Service-
disqualifying  medical  condition  for  any  Airman  regardless  of  rank,  is  responsible  for submitting the case to the DAWG via the PEBLO or MSME. 
4.52.1.2.  (2)  DAWG Surveillance Tracking of AAC 31 determines that a member has a chronic  condition  which  may  preclude him/her  from  performing  duties  or  deploying  to 
field  conditions.    Regardless  of  the  diagnosis,  after  12  months  of  cumulative  AAC  31 status  for  the  same  or  related  issue(s),  the  full  case  must  be  referred  to  DPAMM  via  a 
RILO for adjudication review.

4.52.1.3.  (3)  Commander   Requests   evaluation   due   to   poor   duty   performance   or deployment concerns stemming from a potential medical or mental health condition. 
4.52.1.4.  (4)  DPAMM  directs.    DPAMM  may  identify  conditions  via  an  Annual  or Modified RILO and direct the MTF to submit an Initial RILO package. 
4.52.1.5.  (5)  PCS,  TDY  or  Deployment  Cancellation  or  Curtailment  for  a  medical  or mental health reason. 
4.52.2.  Preliminary  review  of  a  trigger  event  should  occur  at  the next  scheduled  DAWG meeting, and not more than 45 days after the case is referred to the PEBLO or MSME by the 
provider. The DAWG will review each case using the following criteria: 4.52.2.1.  (1)  Is  timing  appropriate  for  Initial  RILO  Referral?   Verify the Member‘s 
hospitalization or treatment progress appears to have medically stabilized (and the course of further recovery is relatively predictable). This wording replaced the term ―Optimal 
Medical  and  Hospital  Benefit‖  under  E3.P1.6.1  DoDI  1332.38  [see  Personnel  and Readiness  Policy  Memorandum  on  Implementing  Disability-Related  Provisions  of  the 
National Defense Authorization Act of 2008, 14 Oct 08]. There is no minimum medical evaluation  time  period  and  no  need  to  wait  for  complete  or  near-complete  recovery.  
There should be no delay in referral of a member‘s case as long as the course of recovery is  relatively  predictable,  and  a  reasonable  determination  can  be  made  that  the  limiting 
condition is not likely to resolve or improve within 12 months to an extent which renders the SM capable of fully  performing the duties of his/her office, grade, rank or rating, to 
include the ability to deploy to field conditions. 4.52.2.1.1.  In  cases where there is no definitive diagnosis, but the preponderance of 
clinical  evidence  suggests  a  probable  underlying  cause  in  which  the  treatment progress,  and/or  progression  of  the  condition,  appears  to  be  reasonably  predictable, 
Initial RILO processing may proceed without a definitive diagnosis. 4.52.2.1.2.  Neoplastic  Diseases.  A  diagnosis  of  cancer  or  neoplastic  disease  may 
require additional time (beyond 90 days) to establish a clear prognosis.  However, if it is clear the SM will require lengthy treatment, or will be unable to perform his/her job 
for a   protracted   period   of   time,   referral   of   Initial   RILO   to   DPAMM   should expeditiously occur regardless of prognosis. 
4.52.2.1.3.  Solid  Organ  Transplants.  When  it  is  determined  that  a  patient  requires  a solid organ transplant, an Initial RILO shall be submitted within 90 days of the initial 
organ transplant determination date. 4.52.2.2.  (2)  Is the case appropriate for Initial RILO Referral?  Only unfitting conditions 
are  eligible  for  referral.    Unsuiting  conditions  must  be  distinguished  from  unfitting conditions  because  they  are  handled  using  administrative  action.    Unsuiting  conditions 
are  listed  in  Enclosure  5  of  DoDI  1332.38  and  AFI  36-3208,  Administrative  Separation of  Airmen,  and  do  not  qualify  for  disability  processing.    (EXCEPTION:   History  of 
anaphylaxis  and  severe  reactions  requiring  venom  immunotherapy,  although  unsuiting conditions, require an Initial RILO for ALC-C consideration.) 
4.52.2.3.  (3)  Is the member unable to reasonably perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating due to a physical or mental condition which is not likely to resolve 
----------------Page (175) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   177  
or improve such that he/she can perform the duties of his/her office, grade, rank or rating within 12 months? 
4.52.2.4.  (4)  Is this a chronic condition which imposes unreasonable requirements on the military to either maintain or protect the member? 
4.52.2.5.  (5)  Is this a chronic condition which may preclude or limit the member‘s ability to safely and effectively deploy to field conditions? 
4.52.2.6.  (6)  Has an Initial RILO package been directed by DPAMM? 4.52.2.7.  (7)  Is  this  a  condition  with  12  months  of  cumulative  AAC  31  status  for  the 
same or related issue(s)? 4.52.2.8.  (8)  Is the Member refusing required professional, medical or dental care which 
would be necessary to achieve fitness for continued military service?  See 4.63.8.1. 4.52.3.  Upon preliminary review of a case referred due to a trigger event, if it is determined 
that above criteria (1) and (2), plus any of one of criteria (3), (4), or (5) are met, OR if any one  of  criteria  (6), (7), or (8)  are  affirmed,  the  Initial  RILO  package  will  be  completed.    If 
additional  review  of  the  Initial  RILO  package  is  required,  this  will  be  accomplished at  the next  scheduled  DAWG  meeting.    However,  the  Initial  RILO  case  may  be  referred  to 
DPAMM  without  another  DAWG  review  if  the  SGP  and  SGH  concur  the  entire  RILO package meets all requirements. 
4.52.3.1.  Application  of  AAC  37  will  be  directed  by the  DAWG  Chair,  and  applied  in Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical Readiness (PIMR) by the MSME 
as  soon  as  a  case  is  identified  as  meeting  the  criteria  in  4.52.3.    Only  the  DAWG (as  a committee,  or  the  Chair,  as  representative)  and  DPAMM  may  direct  an  AAC  37 
personnel status.  Once applied, the AAC 37 will remain in effect until DPAMM directs removal  via  the  AFPC/FL  4.  For  Reserve  Component  Service  Members  (RCSM),  the 
PEBLO should notify the Reserve Component Medical Unit (RCMU) to initiate AAC 37 and verify the SM‘s entitlement to disability processing. 
4.52.4.  Once a case is identified to meet criteria in 4.52.3, the PEBLO should:  (1) notify the member he/she is being referred for potential MEB, (2) contact the member‘s commander to  
request a commander‘s letter, which clearly describes how the unfitting condition(s) affect the member‘s ability to perform the duties of his/her office, rank, grade and/or rating, and 
forward  the  standardized  letter  template  to  the  commander  via  e-mail,  and  (3)  contact  the provider  (or  providers,  in  cases  where  multiple  specialty  consult  narratives  are  required)  to 
request   a   copy   of   the   RILO   Narrative   Summary   (NARSUM),   supporting   consultant notes/studies, and current AF Form 469 prior to the next scheduled DAWG. 
4.52.4.1.  Any  extenuating  circumstances  resulting  in  delays  in  receipt  of  NARSUM  or other package documentation should be documented in the DAWG minutes. 
4.52.4.2.  In  unique  circumstances,  the  DAWG  chair  may  request  the  provider  expedite the package and/or may call an ad hoc DAWG meeting for expedited case review.  These 
circumstances should also be documented in DAWG minutes. 4.52.4.3.  NARSUMs.    The  same  format  is  used  for  both  the  Initial  RILO  and  for  the 
formal  MEB narrative,  and  is  found  on  the  AFPC  Medical  Retention  Standards  Branch page  of  the  AFMS  Knowledge  Exchange  [go  to  Headquarters  ViewMoreOtherAFPC 
----------------Page (176) Break----------------
  178  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
Medical  Retention  Standards].    A  single  NARSUM  format  is  used  throughout  the process, to alleviate the need for complete NARSUM rewrites if an Initial RILO is later 
directed for MEB. 4.52.4.4.  Consultant   Notes   and/or   Special   Studies.      Conditions   which   require   a 
consultant  note  and/or  studies  are  found  on  the  AFPC  Medical  Retention  Standards Branch     page     of the     AFMS     Knowledge     Exchange     [go     to     Headquarters 
ViewMoreOtherAFPC  Medical  Retention  Standards].  Include  the  latest  consultant  note and/or  update  in  the  package.   Note: Additional  consultant  notes  and/or  studies  not 
directed as described may be included in the Initial RILO package at the discretion of the referring   provider;   however   inclusion   of   these   additional   notes   should   not   delay 
processing  of  the  case.  The  consultation  reports  or  updates,  shall  not  be  older  than  180 days old when received at HQ AFPC Physical Disability Division (DPSD). 
4.52.4.5.  AF Form 469.  If the AF Form 469 is more than 30 days old, the provider must review the AF Form 469 restrictions, updating restrictions as needed to ensure clear and 
accurate  portrayal  of  the  current restrictions  (specifically  relating  to  the  potentially unfitting  condition(s)).    A  comment  will  then  be  made  in  the  Restrictions  section:  
―Provider reviewed restrictions and they are deemed accurate and appropriate on (date inserted).‖    The  importance  of a   clear   and   accurate   AF   Form   469   cannot   be 
overemphasized,  as  this  is  the vital  information  that  will  be  used,  concurrently  with  the commander‘s letter and NARSUM/consults, to ascertain a member‘s fitness for duty. 
4.52.5.  DAWG  Screening  of  Initial  RILO  package.  The  PEBLO  will  assemble  the  (1) NARSUM and accompanying consults/studies; (2) current AF Form 469 (reviewed and dated 
by provider within 30 days prior to submission); and (3) commander‘s letter; the package will  be  reviewed  at  the  DAWG  meeting.    If  desired  by  DAWG  membership,  the  referring 
PCM/provider may  attend to present the case and answer any questions.  Categorization by the DAWG is as follows: 
4.52.5.1.  MEB  Recommended.    It  is  reasonably  determined  the  member  is  most  likely not capable of performing the duties of his/her office, grade, rank or rating. The package 
is forwarded to DPAMM by the PEBLO for adjudication.  The standardized cover sheet checklist  must  be  signed  by  the  DAWG  chair  stating  the  package  is  ―MEB 
Recommended.‖ 4.52.5.2.  Return  to  Duty  Recommended.    Member  has  a  condition  which  is  listed  in 
Chapter 5 of AFI 48-123 and/or has a potentially unfitting condition which may limit or preclude deployment, yet the member is most likely capable of performing the duties of 
his/her  office,  grade,  rank  or  rating  AND  the  condition(s)  is/are  stable,  controlled,  and with  a  low  risk  of  sudden  deterioration.  The  package  is  forwarded  to  DPAMM  by  the 
PEBLO for adjudication.  The standardized cover sheet checklist must be  signed by the DAWG chair stating the package is ―Return to Duty Recommended.‖ 
4.52.5.3.  Other.    Armed  with  the  information  available  in  the  NARSUM,  consults,  AF Form 469 and commander‘s letter, the DAWG may make a determination that the case 
does  not  require  DPAMM  review  at  this  time,  and  may  dismiss  the  case  entirely  or schedule it for DAWG surveillance.  The DAWG should work to minimize the number of 
cases  that  fall  into  this  category  by  completing  efficient  and  effective  screening  in  the preliminary process, as outlined in 4.52.2. 
----------------Page (177) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   179  
4.52.6.  For  RCSMs,  the  RILO  will  be  forwarded  to  the  appropriate  ARC/SGP  for  review.  The  appropriate  ARC/SGP,  who  possesses  the  same  authority  for  ARC  cases  as  DPAMM 
possesses for active duty cases, will provide final disposition instructions (i.e., assignment of ALC-C,  DAC-42, or IDES entry via MEB initiation) to the SM‘s supporting RC and AD 
medical facility. 4.53.  HQ   AFPC/DPAMM   Medical   Retention   Standards   Branch.  The   AFPC   Medical 
Retention Standards branch (DPAMM) is the reviewing body for all active duty RILO reviews, and the sole approval authority for active duty ALC-C, Medical Hold, and non-emergent surgery 
during a SM‘s final six months of service (defined as surgery, which may or may not be necessary,  but  which  is  not  required  urgently  or  emergently  to  save  life,  limb,  or  eyesight).  
DPAMM  is  the  office  of  primary  responsibility  for  implementing  HQ  USAF/SG  policy  on medical  standards  for  continued  active  duty  service,  and  may  provide  interpretations  of  gray 
areas  within  this  AFI  consistent  with  current  HQ  USAF/SG  intent.  DPAMM  also  has  the authority to direct Patient Squadron assignments when a facility is otherwise unable to obtain an 
accepting  Patient  Squadron  for  a  patient  with  a  valid  requirement,  and  the  MTF/TRICARE network of that Patient Squadron has the necessary healthcare capability the patient requires. 
4.53.1.  DPAMM pre-IDES Screening and Adjudication of Initial RILOs: 4.53.1.1.  Following DAWG review of an Initial RILO, cases classified per 4.52.5.1 and 
4.52.5.2  are  forwarded  to  DPAMM  for  adjudication.    Adjudication  disposition  shall  be forwarded to the base PEBLO via the AFPC/FL 4. 
4.53.1.2.  The disposition by DPAMM is final and has the same effect and authority as a MEB.  Dispositions are: 
4.53.1.2.1.  Return  to  Duty  (with/without  an  Assignment   Limitation  Code)  and remove AAC 37. 
4.53.1.2.2.  Direct an MEB and maintain AAC 37. 4.53.1.2.3.  Direct an MEB at another MTF and maintain AAC 37. 
4.53.1.2.4.  Returned  without  Action  (reason  and  disposition  of  AAC  37  will  be specified). 
4.53.1.2.5.  Continued Military Medical Observation and Care and maintain AAC 37. 4.53.1.3.  If  a  MEB  is  required  on  a  Flag  Officer, DPAMM  will  designate  a  MTF  to 
conduct  the board. DPAMM  will  forward initial notification  to  AF/DSG and  AF/SG by electronic  secure  transmission  and  provide final  notification  when  the MEB/PEB  action 
is  complete  if  the  Flag  Officer  is  returned  to  duty.    (AFPC/DPSD  will  make  the  final notification if the Flag Officer is medically separated or retired.) 
4.53.1.4.  Presumption of Fitness. For those with an approved retirement date within the next 12 months, the ―Presumption of Fitness‖ policy may be applied  to  a  case  decision 
during  the  DPAMM  RILO  adjudication  process,  resulting  in  a  RTD  decision  without  a full MEB. Presumption of fitness applies to retirement, not to separation of members who 
are not eligible for retirement.  Refer to DoDI 1332.38, Paragraph E3.P3.5.1. and AFI 36-3212, Paragraph 3.17. for additional information. 
----------------Page (178) Break----------------
  180  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.53.1.5.  Only  DPAMM,  ARC/SGP,  AFPC/DPSD  (IPEB  and  Formal  Board),  and  the SECAF may invoke Presumption of Fitness.  MTF providers, the DAWG and MTF MEB 
members  are  prohibited  from  using  or  claiming  Presumption  of  Fitness  to  deny  a  SM MEB consideration. 
4.53.1.6.  Medical Hold is a method of retaining a SM beyond an established retirement or  separation  date for reason  of  disability  processing,  when  presumption  of  fitness  does 
not apply.  It may be necessary to place members on Medical Hold if DPAMM directs an MEB, and the member is within 60 days of separation or retirement.  It will not be used 
for  the  purpose  of  evaluating  or  treating  chronic  conditions,  performing diagnostic studies,  elective  treatment  of  remedial  defects,  non-emergent  surgery  or  its  subsequent 
convalescence,  civilian  employment  issues,  preservation  of  terminal  leave,  or  for  any other  condition  which  does  not  warrant  termination  of  active  duty.    Separation  or 
retirement processing continues until Medical Hold is approved. 4.53.1.6.1.  Medical  Hold  is  requested  by  a  provider  (generally  the  PCM),  directly 
contacting DPAMM, or the appropriate RCMU when the individual is a RCSM.  For ANG  SMs,  ANG/SGP  is  the  approval  authority.    For  Air  Force  Reserve  SMs, 
AFRC/SGP  is  the  approval  authority.    The  requesting  physician  should  have  the following information readily available, in addition to being familiar with the medical 
aspects of the case: 4.53.1.6.1.1.  Date of projected separation or retirement. 
4.53.1.6.1.2.  Whether  Initial  RILO  processing  has  been  initiated,  and  if  so,  the estimated  time  until  the  Initial  RILO  package  will  be  ready  for  submission  to 
DPAMM. 4.53.1.6.1.3.  Whether  administrative  separation  or  Court  Martial  charges  are 
pending. 4.53.1.6.1.4.  Servicing    Military    Personnel    Section    (MPS)    implementing 
separation or retirement. 4.53.1.6.1.5.  Whether  SM  desires  to  be  retained  in  duty  status  for  disability 
processing. 4.53.1.6.1.6.  Member‘s AFSC. 
4.53.1.6.1.7.  Confirmation that the PEBLO and either the SGH or SGP has been notified of the provider‘s intent to request Medical Hold. 
4.53.1.6.2.  DPAMM (or ARC/SGP) may direct a modified (expedited) RILO prior to approving Medical Hold. 
4.53.1.6.3.  Enlisted SMs  may  refuse  Medical  Hold  beyond  their Date of  Separation (DOS)  or  Expiration  of  Term  of  Service  (ETS),  and  must  agree,  in  writing,  to  a 
Medical  Hold.    For  officers, Medical  Hold  does  not  require  consent,  but  DPAMM may  request  consent  in  writing.  The  PEBLO  must  contact  DPAMM  immediately 
when notified that a SM may decline Medical Hold. 4.53.2.  DPAMM Initial RILO results returned to MTF: 
----------------Page (179) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   181  
4.53.2.1.  If the  SM  is  RTD  with  or  without  an  ALC-C,  the  PEBLO  is  notified  by DPAMM via the AFPC/FL 4.  In turn, the PEBLO notifies the PCM and the MSME.  AF 
Forms 422 and 469 will be generated or updated as indicated IAW AFI 10-203. 4.53.2.2.  If  DPAMM  directs an  MEB,  the  PEBLO  is  notified  via  AFPC/FL4.    The 
PEBLO,  in  turn,  notifies  the  PCM,  the  DAWG  chair,  and  the  SGH.      The  PCM  (or alternate provider if PCM is unavailable) will complete the VA Form 21-0819 VA/DoD 
Joint Disability Evaluation Board Claim form and return it to the PEBLO.  The date the provider signs the VA Form 21-0819 is the date that the member officially enters into the 
DES. 4.53.3.  SMs  may  not  refuse,  decline,  nor  stop  any  RILO,  MEB,  PEB,  or  fitness  for  duty 
evaluations except in cases prescribed in DoDI 1332.38, para E3.P2.7, Waiver of MEB/PEB Evaluation. 
4.53.4.  Leave/TDY. Once the SM is notified by the PEBLO that an MEB has been directed, the  SM  will  be  required  to  be  available  for  VA  appointments,  PEBLO  counseling,  and  the 
MEB  process.    MTFs  must  develop  local  processes  and  procedures  with  unit  commanders regarding the availability of SMs in the IDES to meet all appointments (e.g., requesting SMs 
not be placed on leave outside the local area or TDY, except for emergencies, notifying the PEBLO when a SM cannot make an appointment, etc). 
4.53.4.1.  Once  the  MEB  package  has  been  sent  to  the  IPEB,  the  member  may  not  take leave or go TDY without permission from AFPC/DPSD. 
4.54.  DES Program. 4.54.1.  Regardless  of  the date that  the information  is  electronically  populated  into  VTA  by 
the PEBLO, the date of  entry  into  the DES  is the  date the provider  signs  the VA  Form  21-0819.        DES  timeliness  goals  are  detailed  in  separate  DoD  guidance,  and  includes  VA 
appointments for disability evaluation. 4.54.2.  Once   the   VA   medical   evaluations   have   been   completed   in   the   form   of   the 
Compensation and Pension (C&P) evaluation, the PEBLO will receive the C&P results and provide  them  to  the  PCM,  referring  provider,  or  to  a  reviewing  provider  who  has  been 
assigned by the DAWG. 4.54.3.  NARSUM  Review,  Update and  Completion.    Once  the PCM,  referring  provider, or 
reviewing provider receives the C&P exam results, he/she will (1) review the C&P report; (2) verify the  NARSUM  covers  the  full  spectrum  of  potentially  unfitting  conditions;  (3) 
addend/update  the  NARSUM  appropriately;  and  (4)  return  the  updated  NARSUM  to  the PEBLO.  A signed/dated addendum with pertinent updates must be located at the end of the 
NARSUM, and must clarify inconsistencies between the initial NARSUM and C&P only for conditions  which  are  considered  unfitting  for  continued  military  service.  If  there  are  no 
inconsistencies  or  updates,  the provider  will  sign/date the following  statement  at  the end  of the NARSUM: ―I have reviewed the C&P exam results and find the information within the 
NARSUM to be current and complete.‖  This date now becomes the new date for NARSUM currency.  The provider‘s duty title must be clearly discernable. 
4.54.3.1.  For cases in which a single NARSUM is replaced by multiple specialty consult NARSUMs,  a  single  reviewing  physician  may  review  both  the  C&P  Exam  and  the 
----------------Page (180) Break----------------
  182  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
multiple   specialty   NARSUMs,   and   provide   a   signed   and   dated   addendum   on   a continuation  sheet,  which  will  accompany  the  complete  MEB  package  through  routing.  
In  this  case,  the  date  on  the  continuation  sheet  now  becomes  the  new  date  of  the NARSUM. 
4.54.4.  The preparing and reviewing physicians will not include verbal or written comments relating to the expected disability process outcome. 
4.55.  Non-physician  providers  preparing  the  NARSUM.  When  non-physician  providers (optometrist, podiatrist, clinical psychologist, physician assistant, nurse practitioner) prepare the 
NARSUM, it must be reviewed and counter-signed by a physician trained or experienced in the same  or  a  related  specialty  area  as  the  non-physician  provider;  e.g.,  ophthalmologist  for 
optometry,  orthopedics  for  podiatry,  and  psychiatry  for  psychology.    Board  certified  family physicians and internists may countersign if they are currently holding privileges in fields related 
to the patient‘s condition. 4.56.  Conducting  the  MEB.  After  the  NARSUM  is  reviewed,  updated  and  the  completed 
NARSUM  has  been  returned  to  the  PEBLO  (see  4.55.),  the  MEB  shall  meet.    Sections  4.57. through 4.68. provide guidance for the MEB Process. 
4.57.  Where MEBs should be accomplished. 4.57.1.  SMs should receive MEB processing at the MTF where they receive the majority of 
their  care,  or  at  the  MTF  closest  to  their  duty  location.    However,  if  the  identified  MTF cannot  provide  the  necessary  care  or  assessment,  the  MTF  may,  upon  acceptance  by  an 
alternate MTF, refer the case to an MTF with appropriate services. 4.57.2.  If an AD member is hospitalized away from his/her installation of assignment or in a 
non-Air  Force  facility,  the  nearest  Air  Force  MTF  will  accept  administrative  responsibility for the LOD and MEB process.  The member‘s PCM should remain informed of the patient‘s 
condition. 4.57.3.  Commanders at  all  levels,  and  officers  who  have  convening  and  approval  authority 
for  medical  boards,  will  not  have  their  own  MEB  or  their  clinical  evaluation  and  board processing at an MTF that is within their command and control or official influence. In this 
circumstance, DPAMM will designate an MTF to accomplish the board. 4.57.4.  Any MTF-assigned officer requiring an MEB shall not meet the MEB at his/her own 
MTF without a policy waiver from DPAMM.  The MTF Commander may  submit a waiver request  detailing  why  an  MEB  should  be  conducted  at  his/her  own  facility,  as  well  as  why 
the commander has no concern for a conflict of interest. 4.57.5.  An  MTF  will  not  conduct  an  MEB  on  an  assigned  enlisted  staff member  who  has 
been or is currently a disciplinary problem, or when there would be concern for a conflict of interest.  If a waiver is requested from DPAMM, the MTF Commander is required to include 
a brief statement indicating the nature of the disciplinary problem.  Once received, DPAMM will respond with disposition instructions. 
4.58.  MEB  Support  for  SMs  assigned  to  Geographically  Separated  Units  (GSUs)  or enrolled  to  TRICARE  Prime  Remote  (TPR)  location.  If  unique  circumstances  or  mission 
requirements  mandate  that  some  or  all  pre-MEB or clinical case ―work-up‖ be completed via 
----------------Page (181) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   183  
TPR network providers, approval to use TPR providers for MEB assessment must be granted by the DAWG assigned to manage that GSU or remote location. 
4.58.1.  The DAWG must review the status of GSU SMs undergoing pre-MEB workup every 30  days.    The  PEBLO  will  become  the  liaison  and  (1)  notify  the  Military  Medical  Support 
Office (MMSO) Case Management Division that the SM‘s pre-MEB  medical  care  will  be provided  by  TRICARE/TPR  network  providers;  (2)  obtain  medical  release  authorization 
from  the  patient,  contacting  the  civilian  provider(s)  every  30  days  for  written  clinical updates/consults; and (3) notify the MMSO of the MEB outcome. 
4.59.  Multi-Service MEB Processing. 4.59.1.  Historically,  Air  Force  MTFs  have  accepted  MEB  referrals  from  non-Air  Force 
MTFs,  PCMs  and/or  specialists  for  Airmen  assigned  to  their  Military  Personnel  Section (MPS).      The   PEBLO   at   the   Air   Force   MTF   receives   a   NARSUM   and   supporting 
diagnostic/clinical  consultation(s).    In  these  cases,  the  DAWG  at  the  receiving  MTF  will review the case and decide whether the submitted NARSUM and consults are appropriate, or 
if new or supplemental documentation is required. 4.59.2.  Referral date entry into any joint-service DES tracking application for an Airman, by 
a non-Air Force MTF, is premature.  Only the Air Force MTF that receives the non-Air Force MTF  MEB  referral  has  the  authority  to  initiate the  formal  MEB  process,  after  Initial  RILO 
screening has been completed by DPAMM, and then enter a referral date into a joint-service DES tracking application. 
4.59.3.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  a  SM‘s  parent  Service  to  make  the  Fitness  for  Duty decision. 
4.60.  Processing  MEBs  for  SMs  from  other  Services.  Air Force  MTFs  may  refer a  Soldier, Sailor,  or  Marine,  who  is  enrolled  or  empanelled  to  an  Air  Force  MTF,  to  their  local  DAWG 
provided all the following requirements are met: 4.60.1.  (1)  The DAWG Chair approves the action. 
4.60.2.  (2)  The  MEB   president  has  reasonable  operational  knowledge  of  the  specific Service‘s medical retention standards. 
4.60.3.  (3)  Prior  to  the  referral,  written  permission,  from  the  MTF  Commander,  senior physician responsible for evaluating occupational medical standards and/or profiles, or senior 
operational physician at the nearest MTF that shares the same Service affiliation of the SM in question, must be obtained. 
4.60.4.  (4)  The MTF approving official from the nearest MTF that shares the same Service affiliation of the SM must acknowledge that  Air Force MEBs may  be processed differently 
from Army or Navy processes and medical/service retention standards may be different. 4.60.5.  The  Air Force  MTF  will  forward  the  results  of  the  MEB  and  all  related  medical 
supporting documents to the nearest MTF that shares the same Service affiliation of the SM after the MEB has met so that the package can go to the appropriate Service‘s PEB or DES 
system.

  184  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.60.6.  Air  Force  MTFs  that  regularly  agree  to  process  MEBs  for  SMs  from  the  Army, Navy,   or   Marines   are   highly   encouraged   to   establish   agreements   (memorandum   of 
understanding or agreement) with the referring medical unit. 4.61.  Composition of the Medical Evaluation Board (MEB). 
4.61.1.  Only physicians may participate as voting members.  The board is comprised of three privileged  physicians,  ideally  active  duty  Medical  Corps  officers  of  the  United  States 
Uniformed  Services.  Physician  interns  and  residents  are  not  authorized  members.    Civilian physicians  and/or  consultants,  and  retired  medical  officers  who  hold  privileges  at  the  MTF 
may serve as board members.  Note that privileges refers to a physician‘s granted privileges to practice medicine at the MTF, and not to a specific ―serve as MEB member‖ privilege on 
the privilege list. 4.61.2.  Before  appointment,  and  annually  thereafter,  each  MEB  member  is  required  to 
complete  training  to  be  familiarized/updated   with  MEB  processes  and  DES  program objectives.    The  SGH  is  encouraged  to  contact  AFMOA/SGH  to  obtain  the  latest  training 
information.  Physicians are also invited to attend PEBLO training courses (when offered). 4.61.3.  The  SGH  or  the  SGP  will  serve  as  the  MEB President.    Deputies  SGH  and  SGP, 
when appointed by the MTF Commander in writing, are authorized the same MEB authority as the permanent or primary officials in absence of the primary official. 
4.62.  Required Medical Documentation for the local MTF MEB. 4.62.1.  NARSUM.  See 4.54.3. 
4.62.2.  Consultation Notes.  See 4.52.4.4. 4.62.3.  Standardized Commander‘s Letter using the template found on the AFPC Medical 
Retention  Standards  Branch  page  of  the  AFMS  Knowledge  Exchange [go  to  Headquarters ViewMoreOtherAFPC Medical Retention Standards]. 
4.62.4.  AF Form 469.  Duty Limiting Condition Report. See 4.52.4.5. 4.62.5.  AF Form 618.  Medical Board Report. 
4.63.  Convening the MEB. 4.63.1.  Whenever possible, the MEB members should meet at the same time for interactive 
discussion and case review.  Exceptions to this can only be granted by the SGH or SGP. 4.63.2.  Personal appearance of the SM is not required, but the board president may allow (at 
his or her discretion) the SM to appear before the board for statements. There is no right to counsel or to challenge the MEB or its members. 
4.63.3.  MEB recommendations. The MEB membership may choose from the following two actions: (1) Return to Duty or (2) Refer to IPEB.  Note:  Even though the MEB was initially 
directed by DPAMM following Initial RILO screening, rare instances may arise where, at the time of MEB, new information will be available (e.g., condition changes, updated consults, 
information from C&P Exam, updated commander‘s letter, etc.) that result in a vote for Return  to  Duty  instead  of  Refer  to  IPEB.    When  this  occurs,  the  complete  case  will  be 
forwarded to DPAMM, instead of being forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPSD (IPEB). 4.63.4.  MEB members will sign AF Form 618, block 26. 
----------------Page (183) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   185  
4.63.5.  Whenever discussion  does  not  result  in  a  unanimous  decision,  the  MEB  clerk  must record dissenting vote counts and each respective reason on the reverse of AF Form 618, and 
mark block 27 appropriately. 4.63.6.  Boards for a mental health diagnosis or when cognitive dysfunction is expected: 
4.63.6.1.  Whenever  the  MEB  convenes  to  review  a  case  involving  a  mental  health diagnosis,   or   if   cognitive   dysfunction   is   suspected   due   to   either   head   trauma   or 
intracranial  disease,  at  least  one  member  must  be  a  psychiatrist,  and  is  identified  by marking an ―X‖ in the box to the right of his/her signature on AF Form 618, block 26. 
4.63.6.2.  Psychiatric   evaluations   must   include the   degree   of   social   and   industrial impairment for civilian life, and degree of impairment for military service. 
4.63.6.3.  The   MEB   members   must   ensure   that   special   provisions   for   reporting psychiatric  cases  have  been  followed:  Multi-axial  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of 
Mental  Disorders  (DSM)  diagnosis  reporting  is  required  with  all  five  axes,  including personality assessment and Global Assessment of Function (GAF).  When describing the 
degree of impairment for civilian, social and industrial adaptability for all boardable Axis I cases, use of degree term references is limited to: Total, Severe, Considerable, Definite, 
Mild, or None.  For degree of impairment for military service, use the degree of the SM‘s current   and   projected   impairment   for military   service:   No   Impairment,   Minimal, 
Moderate, or Marked. 4.63.7.  Competency Boards and Sanity Boards.  In a case where a SM‘s competency for pay 
and records is called into question, or in a Court-Martial case where a SM‘s sanity is called into  question,  the  MEB  must  be  composed  of  three  Uniformed  Services  Medical  Corps 
officers, one of whom must be a psychiatrist. [If the member is comatose, he/she is presumed incompetent and no psychiatrist is required].  For Competency Boards, in addition to signing 
the  AF  Form  618,  the  board  determines  whether  the  attending  physician  was  correct  in his/her determination of the member‘s competence and annotate this in block 23a of the AF 
Form  618.  If  the  member  is  declared  incompetent  for  pay  and  records,  add  to  block  22, ―DFAS DEM 177-373.‖ For Sanity Boards, findings are annotated in block 24 of the AF 
Form 618. The psychiatrist on the Board must be identified by marking an ―X‖ in the box to the right of his/her signature on AF Form 618, block 26. 
4.63.7.1.  When  incompetence  is  determined,  additional  copies  of  AF  Form  618  are distributed  to  accounting  and  finance  authorities.  This  must  be  done  without  delay. 
Failure to safeguard the pay of members declared mentally incompetent to manage their own affairs has caused serious hardship to members and their families. 
4.63.8.  Boards under unique situations: 4.63.8.1.  SMs  who  refuse  required  professional,  medical  or  dental  care,  and/or  other 
necessary treatment options may be required to meet an MEB.  Refer when: 4.63.8.1.1.  The SM was clearly advised of the necessary course of treatment, therapy, 
medication, or duty limiting or physical restriction. 4.63.8.1.2.  The SM‘s failure or refusal was willful or negligent and not the result of 
mental disease or of physical inability to comply. 
----------------Page (184) Break----------------
  186  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.63.8.1.3.  The  SM  refuses  to  submit  to  medical,  surgical,  or  dental  treatment  or diagnostic  procedures.    If  the  refusal  is  based  on  religious  grounds,  arrange  for  the 
appointment  of  a  military  chaplain  as  a  special  advisor  to  the  board.    The  MEB determines: 
4.63.8.1.4.  Whether  or  not  the  SM  requires  the  procedure  in  order  to  properly perform military duties or establish medical qualification for continued service. 
4.63.8.1.5.  Whether  or  not  the  procedure,  according  to  accepted  medical  or  dental principle,  will  be  likely  to  produce  the  desired  results.  If  analysis  confirms  the 
required  procedure  or  treatment  is  necessary  to  continue  military  service  and  if  the required procedure or treatment will likely achieve the desired effect, and the SM still 
refuses, forward the Initial RILO package to DPAMM. 4.64.  MEB  Review  and  Approval  Authority.  Clinical sufficiency review authority rests with 
the SGH and SGP.  The MEB President, whether the SGH or SGP, must review each completed MEB  package  before  it  is  submitted to  HQ  AFPC/DPSD IPEB,  attesting  to  the following  final 
review: 4.64.1.  The  SM‘s  potential  Service-disqualifying   medical   condition   and   associated 
healthcare,  has  been  adequately  documented  in  the  NARSUM  which  will  not  be  older  than 30 days when received by HQ AFPC/DPSD, and with appropriate attached consults that will 
be no older than 180 days when received by HQ AFPC/DPSD. [Note:  the 30 day age limit is excluding  the time the member is  granted to  submit  a  rebuttal,  and  the time the Convening 
Medical Authority is granted to respond to the rebuttal.  See 4.67.] 4.64.2.  A  physician  review  of  the  C&P  is  recorded  via  an  addendum.    A  NARSUM  with 
updated  comments,  or  with  a  dated  statement  that  no  additions  or  clarifications  were required, or a continuation statement, is substituted if multiple NARSUMs are present.  See 
4.55. 4.64.3.  A standardized commander‘s letter is present that clearly describes how the unfitting 
condition(s) affect the member‘s ability to perform the duties of his/her office, rank, grade and/or  rating.    Ensure  that  the  commander‘s  letter  used  the  template  required  by  HQ 
AFPC/DPSD, and will not be more than 120 days old when received by HQ AFPC/DPSD. 4.64.4.  The  AF  Form  469  has  been  reviewed  by  a  physician,  preferably  the  PCM  and/or 
provider submitting the NARSUM, within the last 30 days, and a dated statement of review is located in the ―restrictions‖ section of the AF Form 469.  See 4.52.4.5. 
4.64.5.  SM‘s hospitalization or treatment progress appears to have medically stabilized (and the  course  of  further  recovery  is  relatively  predictable),  and  it  is  unlikely  that  the  member 
would be capable of returning to duty within 12 months. 4.64.6.  The MTF Commander is not required to sign AF  Form 618, blocks 28 (a-d).  Until 
the new AF 618 is produced, ―not required per AFI 41-210‖ will be printed in block 28(c), prior to having the SM sign AF Form 618. 
4.65.  Notification  of  MEB  Results  to  SM.  Following  the  recommendation  of  the  MEB,  the PEBLO  or  MEB  clerk  should  ensure  that  blocks  1-27  of  AF  Form  618  are  completed.  The 
PEBLO   will   meet   with   the   member,   provide   a   copy   of   the   AF   618   and   Narrative Summary/consults, and Commander‘s letter to the member, and explain the findings of the MEB 
----------------Page (185) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   187  
(without speculating as to potential PEB outcome), and answer any questions the SM may have regarding the content. 
4.65.1.  The  PEBLO  will  then explain  the  options  of  the  Impartial  Review  and/or  Rebuttal Letter, and give the SM three duty days to decide if he/she requests (1) an Impartial Review 
(with or without subsequent Rebuttal Letter); (2) to decline the Impartial Review and submit a  Rebuttal  Letter  within  seven  duty  days  of  the  decision;  or  (3)  to  decline  the  Impartial 
Review and the Rebuttal Letter options. 4.65.2.  If the SM declines the Impartial Review and Rebuttal Letter options, the PEBLO will 
ask the SM to sign and date the AF Form 618 Medical Board Report, blocks 29(a) and 29(b) signifying  that  he  or  she  has  been  informed  of  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the 
MEB. 4.65.2.1.  After  the  member  signs  the  AF  Form  618,  the  PEBLO  shall  assemble  and 
forward  the  MEB  package  to  the  IPEB  per  the  instructions  of  the  checklist  in  the Disability  Counseling  Guide  for  Physical  Evaluation  Board  Liaison  Officers,  published 
by HQ AFPC/DPSD. 4.66.  Impartial Review.  If the SM requests an impartial review, an impartial physician or other 
appropriate healthcare professional (not involved in the SM‘s MEB process) must be assigned to offer a review of the medical evidence presented by the NARSUM and associated consults. 
4.66.1.  The  impartial  health  professional  should  advise  the  SM  within  five  duty  days  on whether  the  MEB  findings  adequately  reflect  the  complete  spectrum  of  injuries  and/or 
illnesses.  For  cases  in  which the  Impartial  Review does  not  validate  the  MEB  findings,  the Impartial  Reviewer will  contact  the MEB Board  President  (SGH  or  SGP  who signed  block 
26 on AF Form 618) concurrently with notification to the SM. 4.66.1.1.  In such cases, the MEB Board President must consider whether changes to the 
MEB package are warranted, and whether to reconvene the MEB once changes have been documented. 
4.67.  Rebuttal Letters.  Armed with the decision of the MEB and, if requested, the information from  the  Impartial  Review,  the  member  may  choose  to  submit  a  Rebuttal  Letter  to  the  MEB 
Convening Medical Authority (CMA). 4.67.1.  Per DoDI 1332.38, E2.1.33, the CMA must be a senior medical officer, appointed by 
the  MTF  Commander,  with  detailed  knowledge  of  directives  pertaining  to  standards  of medical fitness and disposition of patients, disability separation processing and familiar with 
the Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD).  It is recommended that the MTF Commander consider the SGH, SGP and Senior Profile Officer as the appointed MTF 
Convening  Medical  Authority  primary  and  alternates,  if  the  MTF  Commander  is  not  a physician.  See  Personnel  and  Readiness  Policy  Memorandum  on  Implementing  Disability-
Related Provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008, 14 Oct 08. 4.67.1.1.  The acting CMA for any particular case may not be one of the three physicians 
who served on the MEB, and may not be the Impartial Reviewer for that particular case. 4.67.2.  If  the  SM  requested  an  Impartial  Review,  the  SM  shall  be  afforded  seven  calendar 
days from the date of Impartial Reviewer notification of review results to prepare a Rebuttal Letter and submit it to the MEB Convening Medical Authority, who shall be afforded seven 
----------------Page (186) Break----------------
  188  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
calendar days to consider the Rebuttal Letter and return the fully documented decision to the SM. 
4.67.3.  If  the  SM  did  not  request  an  Impartial  Review,  but  chooses  to  submit  a  Rebuttal Letter, the SM will be afforded seven calendar days from the date of decision established in 
section 4.65.1. (2) to prepare a Rebuttal Letter and submit it to the MEB Convening Medical Authority,  who  shall  be  afforded  seven  calendar  days  to  consider  the  Rebuttal  Letter  and 
return the fully documented decision to the SM. 4.67.4.  If the member submits a Rebuttal Letter, the MEB results shall not be forwarded to 
the PEB until the Rebuttal process is finalized and MEB results indicate the SM may be unfit for  duty.    The  fully  documented  Rebuttal  Letter,  and  response,  will  be  included  with  the 
MEB  package  sent  to  the  PEB.  Exceptions  to  timelines  may  be  granted by  an  authority appointed by the SAF. 
4.67.5.  At the conclusion of the Impartial Review and/or Rebuttal process, the PEBLO will counsel the SM and ask him/her to sign and date the AF Form 618, blocks 29(a) and 29(b) 
signifying that he or she has been informed of the findings and has received the response to the  Rebuttal  Letter,  and  recommendations  of  the  MEB.      After  the  PEBLO  meets  with  the 
member, the PEBLO assembles the package and forwards it to IPEB per the instructions of the  Disability  Counseling  Guide  for  Physical  Evaluation  Board  Liaison  Officers,  published 
by HQ AFPC/DPSD. 4.67.6.  If the SM submitted a Rebuttal Letter, the PEBLO will assure the member that both 
the Rebuttal Letter and the Convening Medical Authority‘s response to the  Rebuttal  Letter will be included in the package which will be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPSD to the Informal 
Physical Evaluation Board (IPEB). 4.67.7.  If the SM has been determined to be incompetent (blocks 22 and 23 of AF Form 618, 
or  the case  has  been  designated deleterious  (AF  Form  1172),  the MEB  recorder or  PEBLO addresses the above mentioned actions to the SM‘s next of kin (NOK) or legal guardian, who 
is entitled to the same rights, privileges, and counseling benefits as the SM. 4.68.  PEBLO MEB Special Considerations. 
4.68.1.  For privileged providers undergoing MEB, the Chief of the Medical Staff will submit a statement regarding the current status of the privileges.  A simple memorandum format is 
acceptable, although a DD Form 2499 is recommended if the provider is unlikely to return to full   and   unrestricted   duty.   For   non-credentialed   providers   enrolled   to   GME   training 
programs, the Program Director will provide this statement for the package. 4.68.2.  Waivers.    A  copy  of DPAMM  waiver  approval  to  conduct  MEB  locally  for  certain  
SMs assigned to the MTF.  Refer to paragraphs 4.57.3-4.57.5. 4.68.3.  AF Form 565, Record of Inpatient Treatment, if applicable. 
4.68.4.  Other reports as needed or requested for RCSMs. 4.68.5.  Cases  Returned  from  HQ  AFPC/DPSD.    If  additional  information  is  required  or 
requested  from  AFPC,  the  MTF  Commander,  or  designee,  is  required  to  respond  by endorsement  confirmation,  that  the  requested  information  was  obtained.  AFPC  determines 
the package return suspense date. 
----------------Page (187) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   189  
4.68.5.1.  The  MTF  Commander  or  designee  will  advise  members  of  the  MEB  and examining  physician  that  the  case  was  returned,  the  reason  for  its  return,  and  suspense 
any requests. 4.68.6.  Changes in Condition/New Condition in SMs undergoing IPEB adjudication. 
4.68.6.1.  If  a  SM,  for  whom  an  MEB  case  has  already  been  sent  to  the  IPEB,  is diagnosed  with  a  new  ―boardable‖  condition,  the  case  may  require  a  recall  of  the 
previously  submitted  case.    If  a  recall  is  indicated,  the  MTF  Commander  or  designee (SGH or SGP)  will contact AFPC/DPSD in writing per AFI 36-3212, Chp 2, to request 
the recall. 4.68.6.2.  If a SM receives or possesses orders for separation or retirement as a result of a 
disability determination, and the SM has not yet been released from active duty and then experiences  a  significant  clinical  change  in  their  condition,  the  MDG/CC  or  designee 
(SGH or SGP) will contact AFPC/DPSD (not DPAMM) to ascertain whether retirement or separation orders should be revoked and another MEB be initiated. 
4.69.  MTF  Commander  Responsibility  for  MEB  Process.  Every  MTF  Commander  must establish and maintain a viable MEB process.  Each MEB physician member will be appointed, 
in  writing,  by  the  MTF  Commander.    Primary  and  secondary  Convening  Medical  Authorities will be appointed in writing by the MTF Commander. 
4.69.1.  Copies  of  current  appointment  letters  will  be  updated,  at  least  annually,  and whenever  new  members  are  appointed.    Letters  are  maintained  in  the  TOPA  Training 
Records  (PEBLO  Continuity  Binder).  The  SGA  will  ensure  a  copy  is  forwarded  to  HQ AFPC/DPSD   with   each   update.   The   MTF   is   responsible   for   maintaining   all   written 
appointment orders, formal appointment letters,  and Convening Authority  delegation orders for  at  least  three  calendar  years  from  the  date  of  the  appointment  or  delegation.    Maintain 
these documents within the MTF TOPA Training Records (PEBLO Continuity Binder). 4.69.2.  The  MTF  Commander  should  appoint  a  mature  and  experienced  NCO,  SNCO, 
officer,  federal  civilian  employee  or  contract  employee  (with  commensurate  experience and/or  skill  level)  as  the  PEBLO  in  writing.    If  the  PEBLO  is  an  active  duty  member,  it  is 
recommended MTFs maintain them in the position for a minimum of 24-months. The MTF Commander shall forward a copy of this published order or letter to HQ AFPC/DPSD.  The 
MTF  is  responsible  for  maintaining  all  written  appointment  orders,  formal  appointment letters, and annual PEBLO proof of training documents (copies of training certificates and/or 
letters of training certification or validation) for at least three calendar years from the date of the  appointment  or  training  event.    Maintain  these  documents  within  the  MTF  TOPA 
Training Records (PEBLO Continuity Binder). 4.69.2.1.  PEBLO  responsibilities  are  numerous,  and  many  of  them  have  been  detailed 
throughout   the   processes   in   this   instruction.      Others   are   detailed   in   the   DES Implementation  Guide.    Processes  are  further  outlined in  the  following  locations:    The 
Disability Counseling Guide For PEBLOs, published by AFPC/DPSD, and AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation. 
4.69.2.2.  Additional  PEBLO  Responsibilities  prior  to  MEB  include,  but are  not  limited to:    Ensure  LOD  determination  complete  (if  required).    Verify  SM‘s  separation  or 
retirement date.  If a SM‘s DOS or ETS is within 60 calendar days from the date the 
----------------Page (188) Break----------------
  190  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
patient enters VTA, notify HQ AFPC/DPAMM to ascertain whether Medical Hold status is  in  place.    For  Medical  Hold  consideration  affecting  RCSMs,  contact  the  appropriate 
ARC agency.  Obtain all health records, including dental records.   When notifying SM of MEB,  advise  member  to  report  to  the  Family  Support  Center,  Airman  or  Warrior  and 
Family   Readiness   Support   Center   to   obtain   pre-separation   transition   assistance counseling.  Notify the SM‘s commander of leave and TDY restrictions.  Ensure the SM 
was  placed  in  an  AAC  37  personnel  status.  Note  that  Personnel  and  Readiness  Policy Memorandum  on  Implementing  Disability-Related  Provisions  of  the  National  Defense 
Authorization  Act  of  2008,  14  Oct  08,  Enclosure  6,  covers  PEBLOs‘s  assignment guidelines, training, duties and qualifications. 
4.69.2.3.  Each PEBLO must have the ability to manage the important tasks of counseling military  members  undergoing  this  complicated  process.    A  PEBLO  must  possess 
knowledge  of  a) the Disability  Evaluation  System,    b)  basic  VA  Health  Benefits,  c) the Line of Duty Determination program, d) overall MTF operations, e) the Air Force Office 
of Airmen‘s Counsel.  PEBLOs must effectively communicate with internal professional staff,  external  referral  organizations  that  may  be  able  to  provide  non-clinical  support  to 
the SM and his/her family, and officials at HQ USAF. 4.69.2.4.  If a formal PEBLO training course is available, each active MTF PEBLO must 
attend  at  least  one  time  in  his/her  career.    A  formal  course  is  defined  as  a  training program   recognized   either   by   AETC   or   other   standardized   joint-service   academic 
certification  authority  with  identified  academic  learning  objectives  and  goals.    Students completing  Internet  web-based,  or  physical  classroom  environment  courses  are  required 
to  test  and  successfully  pass  smaller  periodic  knowledge  proficiency  examinations,  or pass at least one end-of-course examination that evaluates overall course comprehension.  
If sending all MTF PEBLOs to this course at the same time jeopardizes the overall MTF MEB  mission,  the  MTF  Commander  may  choose  to  send  only  one  PEBLO.    This 
decision must be documented and maintained on file in the TOPA Training Records for at least three years from the date of the signed memorandum. 
4.69.2.5.  If  a  semi-formal  annual  training  course,  class,  or  conference  is  offered  as  a program  not  formally  recognized  by  AETC  or  any  joint-service  academic  certifying 
authority, then at least one MTF PEBLO should attend.   Although a semi-formal course may  not  offer  the  same  structured  learning  requirements  and  environment  as  a  formal 
class,  an  informal  course  allows  a  PEBLO  to  obtain  the  latest  DES  processing  updates, speak  with  senior  AFMS  and  AFPC  officials,  share  best-practice  information  and 
―network‖ with other MTF PEBLOs. 4.69.2.6.  In rare cases, in lieu of a formal or informal training certificate or standardized 
training verification document or mechanism, and based upon the recommendations by 1) the Patient Administration Officer, TOPA/Patient Administration Flight Commander, 2) 
the Chief of the Medical Staff (SGH), and 3) the Chief of Aerospace Medicine (SGP), the MTF Commander must determine when a PEBLO ―trainee‖ has reached a reasonable 
minimum  training  and  job  qualification  experience  level  typically  expected  of  a  fully trained  PEBLO.    This  determination  must  be  documented  and  maintained  in  the  TOPA 
Training  Records  for  a  period  of  no  less  than  three  years  from  the  date  the  MTF Commander  determines  there  is  adequate  evidence  to  consider  the  PEBLO‘s  fully 
qualified. 
----------------Page (189) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   191  
4.69.3.  Each  new PEBLO  is  required  to  spend  at least  three  full  work  weeks  working  with another experienced PEBLO before assuming full duties.  If no other experienced PEBLO is 
available  within  the  MTF  to  provide  required  training,  then  the  MTF  Commander  shall,  a) arrange  for  the  new  PEBLO  to  travel  to  another  MTF  to  receive  training  or,  b)  sponsor  a 
PEBLO from another MTF to travel to their MTF to provide required training.  Verification of  required  PEBLO  training  shall  be  forwarded  to  AFMOA,  Health  Benefits  Division 
(AFMOA/SGAT)  on  a  quarterly  and  annual  basis  according  to  the  established  reporting format.    On-the-job  training  should  be  documented  and  specifically  targeted  to  meet  the 
requirements   identified   on   a   standardized   AF   Form   797,   Job   Qualification   Standard Continuation/Command (JQS) form. 
4.69.4.  The PEBLO‘s active MEB caseload (MEB and TDRL cases) should not exceed 20. If  exceeded,  MTF  Commanders  are  expected  to  appoint  and  train  an  additional  PEBLO  to 
adjust  the  caseload.    For  fluctuations  in  caseload  that  consistently  exceed  a  ratio  of  20:1, MTFs may explore programming options to increase the number of PEBLOs.  If funding is 
available, contracting vehicles via the AF/SG Commodity Council at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio may be pursued. 
4.70.  Performance Reporting and Oversight. 4.70.1.  Quarterly Reports: 
4.70.1.1.  Caseload   &   Training   Reporting.      Quarterly,   each   MTF   responsible   for processing  MEBs,  RILOs,  and/or  TDRL  cases,  will  report  the  number  of  active  cases 
under review or ―open‖ for each workload category,  e.g.,  MEB,  RILO,  and/or  TDRL patient.  Each MTF will report: 
4.70.1.1.1.  The total number of cases (separated by category) for each PEBLO and/or MEB clerk responsible for processing the case. 
4.70.1.1.2.  The  number  of  PEBLOs  assigned that  are  fully  trained,  including  data reporting for those PEBLOs at least 50% trained and 100% trained. 
4.70.1.1.3.  The average number of days (for all combined) active MEB cases, that it takes an MTF to process a typical MEB. 
4.70.1.2.  Report this information to AFMOA/SGAT no later than the fourth calendar day following  the  close-out  of  each  reporting  quarter.    Officials  at  AFMOA/SGAT  will 
transfer information into a report with both singular data and MAJCOM and AFMS totals for  each  category.    This  report  will  be  forwarded  to  AFMSA/SG3SA  no  later  than  the 
sixth  duty  day  following  the  close-out  of  each  reporting  quarter.    AFMSA  will  then forward the report to AFPC/DPSD.  Once received, officials at AFPC will combine this 
information  with other  DES  adjudication  reporting  data  and  forward  the  total  quarterly Air  Force  DES  Performance  Metric  Report  to  the  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of 
Defense,  for  Personnel  &  Readiness  (OUSD/P&R)  no  later  than  the  15th  calendar  day following the close-out of each reporting quarter. 
4.70.2.  Annual Report: 4.70.2.1.  Following the close-out of each fiscal year, each Service is required to submit 
an annual DES Report to OUSD/P&R that covers several areas.  HQ AF/SG will in-turn require  from  AFMOA  for  each  MTF  responsible  for  processing  MEBs,  RILOs,  and  or 
----------------Page (190) Break----------------
  192  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
TDRL cases, (at a minimum) an annual summary of the caseload information submitted quarterly, verification that all PEBLOs  and physicians (who participated in an MEB for 
the previous FY) were properly trained, and whether there were enough skilled PEBLOs assigned to meet the DoD caseload ratio restrictions. 
4.71.  Patient Squadron Assignment. 4.71.1.  Authority.  This section contains the authority for administratively assigning patients 
to  an  Air  Force  medical  unit  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  medical  care,  and/or  for  MEB processing. 
4.71.2.  Active  Duty  Airmen may  be  considered  for  potential  PCS  reassignment  to  an  MTF under one or more of the following conditions. 
4.71.2.1.  Required  medical  care  is  not  available  at  the  MTF  or  reasonably  available  in the local or regional areas. 
4.71.2.2.  There  is  overwhelming  medical  evidence  that  suggests  a  SM  is  not  likely expected to return to Active Duty. 
4.71.2.3.  When  hospitalization  beyond  the  SM‘s  Date  of  Separation  is  expected.  (Contact AFPC/DPAMM to request Medical Hold). 
4.71.2.4.  For  overseas  SMs;  when  the  required  medical  care  is  not  available  in  the overseas area. 
4.71.2.5.  For overseas  SMs;  when  hospitalization  beyond  the  member‘s  DEROS  is expected. 
4.71.2.6.  When HQ AFPC/DPAMM directs. 4.71.3.  General  Information:  Consistent  with  the  needs  of  the  Air  Force,  the  intent  of  the 
patient  assignment  program  is  to  place  SMs  in  MTFs  best  suited  to  address  their  medical needs.    Although  placement  of  the  member  near  family  or  Home  of  Record  may  be 
considered when appropriate, it is not the goal of this program. 4.71.4.  Patient   Squadron   Assignment   vs.   Attachment.      A   Patient   Squadron   can   be 
established  at  any  Air  Force  MTF  regardless  of  size.    When  an  Airman  is  assigned  to  a Patient Squadron, the SM is relocated via official orders in either PCS or PCA capacity.  The 
word  ―assigned‖  implies  a  permanent  personnel  duty  assignment  status,  such  that  the member  does  not  count  against  the  losing  unit  or  the  gaining  MTF‘s  medical  staffing 
positions. The term ―permanent‖ does not mean the Member is permanently reassigned to an MTF.  Following medical treatment, the SM will either be reassigned, or will separate/retire 
through the Disability Evaluation System. 4.71.4.1.  MTF Commanders may publish TDY orders to move patients between MTFs.  
These  Airmen  are  temporarily  attached  to  a  MTF  Patient  Squadron  while  in  a  medical TDY status, but remain assigned to their home unit.  Following TDY medical treatment, 
the  Patient  Squadron  commander  will  return  the  Airman  to  his  or  her  home  unit commander. 
4.71.4.2.  Permanent Change of Station assignment action does not apply to ARC Airmen who may travel to an MTF to receive LOD-related, pre-MEB diagnostic treatment, and/or 
MEB case processing.  While at the MTF, RCSMs are considered attached to the MTF. 
----------------Page (191) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   193  
4.71.5.  The MTF Commander shall assume assignment and command authority over officers and enlisted members assigned to this unique ―squadron.‖  The MTF Commander may 
appoint an officer under his/her command to serve as the Patient Squadron commander. The Patient Squadron commander is responsible for placing both assigned and attached outpatient 
SMs in an MTF or external line unit work center, provided: 4.71.5.1.  the SM is physically and/or mentally capable of completing reasonable normal 
daily activities, and, 4.71.5.2.  the   temporary   placement   of   a SM   within   a   work   center   can   be   safely 
accomplished  without  interfering  with  his  or  her  treatment,  MEB  evaluation,  or  clinical or non-clinical case processing, and, 
4.71.5.3.  the SM‘s attending provider supports the decision, and, 4.71.5.4.  the SM is able to wear his/her uniform (shoe waiver may be used), and, 
4.71.5.5.  the  Patient  Squadron  commander  is  able  to  secure  placement  approval  or permission to place the SM within the work center from the receiving unit commander or 
work center officer or NCO in charge. 4.71.6.  When Hospitalization Over 90 Days is Expected.  Traditionally, when an Airman‘s 
hospitalization was expected to exceed 90 days, assignment to an MTF Patient Squadron was mandatory.    However,  the  decision  to automatically  reassign  Airmen  to  Patient  Squadrons 
sometimes   created   unforeseen   family   and/or   financial   hardships   that   complicated   or worsened  the  patient‘s  medical  status.    As  more  of  our  Airmen,  especially  Wounded 
Warriors,  seek  to  return  to  their  home  military  units  following  hospitalization,  any  official responsible  for  deciding  whether  or  not  to  reassign  an  Airman  to  a  Patient  Squadron, 
especially at another installation, should consider each patient‘s unique situation.  While considering the patient‘s wishes,  the  attending  physician,  the  MTF  Commander,  and  the 
Airman‘s unit commander shall recognize the medical needs of the patient must be regarded above all other considerations. 
4.71.7.  Assignment   approval   rests   with   the   gaining   MTF   Commander (or   designee).  DPAMM  retains  the  final  authority  to  direct  Patient  Squadron  assignments  when  the 
involved parties are unable to come to an agreement and the MTF/TRICARE network of that Patient Squadron has the necessary healthcare capability the patient requires. 
4.71.8.  Permanent Assignment Process:  When deemed appropriate by the local MTF or HQ DPAMM that a PCS move is required, the MTF Commander of the gaining facility requests 
(refer to Attachment 18) the losing MPS to publish PCS or PCA orders.  The losing MPS will publish orders, citing this instruction and section and the MTF Commander‘s message as the 
authority  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  899,  Request  and  Authorization  for Permanent  Change  of  Station - Military.    No  assignment  action  number  is  required.    The 
reporting identifier for officers is 93P0 and the number for enlisted personnel is 9P000.  The official  fund  cite  used  to  pay  for  SM  travel  and  other  related  moving  expenses  is  obtained 
from  the  servicing  base  accounting  and finance  officer.    Refer  to  Attachment  19  for additional information regarding the assignment selection or ―load‖ process.  Other personnel 
requirements  or  actions,  if  applicable,  may  be  addressed  in  AFMAN  36-2622,  Base  Level Military  Personnel  System  User‘s  Manual.    A  SM  may  not  be  assigned  to  the  Patient 
Squadron if a LOD determination (formal or informal) is pending. 
----------------Page (192) Break----------------
  194  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.71.9.  Special Circumstances. 4.71.9.1.  Officers pending judicial or adverse administrative action may not be assigned 
to the  Patient  Squadron  unless  approved  by  the  court  martial  convening  authority  or discharge authority. 
4.71.9.2.  Enlisted   members   pending   judicial   or   adverse   administrative   actions   are attached  TDY  or  assigned  PCS  without  PCA  to  the  Patient  Squadron  unless  PCA  is 
approved by the court martial convening authority or discharge authority. 4.71.9.3.  The  Patient  Squadron  commander  in  each  case  above  is  required  to  continue 
the administrative or discharge action. 4.71.9.4.  Officers  or  Enlisted  in  a  non-Air  Force  MTF  who  meet  requirements  for 
assignment  to  a  Patient  Squadron  are  administratively  attached  to  the  nearest  Air  Force MTF Patient Squadron. 
4.71.9.5.  Re-assignment from Patient Squadron to Duty.  Airmen assigned to the Patient Squadron should receive MEB screening under sections 4.52.-4.54. of this instruction.  If, 
following  treatment,  an  Airman  is  found  to  have  recovered  from  his/her  injuries  or illnesses and has been medically ―cleared‖ or deemed fully capable of returning  to  full 
duty,  send  a  RILO  to  HQ  AFPC/DPAMM.    If  the  member  is  returned  to  duty,  the PEBLO  must  send  reassignment  information,  located  on  the  AFPC  Medical  Retention 
Standards    Branch    page    of    the    Knowledge    Exchange    [go    to    Headquarters ViewMoreOtherAFPC  Medical  Retention  Standards]  to  HQ  AFPC/DPAMM. Note:  
Members must meet PCS minimum ―retainability‖ requirements. 4.71.9.5.1.  When a SM is medically cleared by HQ AFPC/DPAMM, the appropriate 
officer or enlisted assignments department will send a message to the local MPS with assignment instructions. 
4.71.9.6.  Members will not be retained as hospital patients for rehabilitation in order to gain retention on active duty. 
4.71.9.7.  Members  will  not  be  placed  in  the  Patient  Squadron in  order  to  preserve terminal  leave  or  otherwise  to  retain  a  member  beyond  his  or  her  date  of  separation  or 
retirement  without  specific  guidance  from  HQ  AFPC/DPAMM.    Once  a  member  is placed  on  terminal  leave,  he  or  she is  not  permitted to  change  duty  status  without  prior 
approval for Medical Hold or admission to a hospital for an emergency. 4.72.  Veterans Administration (VA) Office.  See further sponsor service affiliation for DEERS 
enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement in AFI 36-3026V1_IP. 4.72.1.  Eligibility  for  VA  Care.  Normally,  members  are  eligible  for  VA  benefits  and 
healthcare  if  they  will  soon  be  released  from  Active  Duty,  they  have  a  service-connected disability   that   was   incurred   while   receiving   basic   pay   or   was   aggravated   by   LOD 
circumstances, and they will receive any Service discharge other than dishonorable. The VA may also treat active duty members by means of inter-agency agreements. 
4.72.2.  Request for Bed. A VA bed may be obtained for a SM if prolonged hospitalization will  be  required.  This  request  is  processed through  the TRANSCOM  Regulating  Command 
and Control and Evacuation System (TRAC2ES). 
----------------Page (193) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   195  
4.72.3.  Movement of Patient. Movement to a VA bed must not occur until after the member or next of kin concurs  with the PEB  findings or submits a rebuttal.  If movement is critical, 
the  MTF  Commander  must  contact  HQ  AFPC/DPSDS  and  the  MTF  nearest  to  the  VA hospital where the patient is being transferred. 
4.72.4.  Patient  Status.  Active  Duty  SMs  who  must  be  treated  at  a  VA  Hospital  before retirement  are  ordered  PCS  without  PCA.  The  servicing  MPS  retains  responsibility.  If 
prolonged disability processing ensues, the member may PCA to the VA hospital, but will be assigned to the Patient Squadron of the nearest Air Force MTF. 
4.72.5.  Required Records. Records transmittal to include all appropriate medical records and completed VA Form 10-1204, Referral for Community Nursing. 
4.72.5.1.  The  PEBLO  will  establish  a  positive  communication  link  with  the  VA  and follow patient until final Air Force disposition is made. 
4.72.6.  Spinal Cord Injuries. Significant spinal cord injuries should be moved to a VA spinal cord center as soon as possible, but not later than 12 days post injury. Movement of members 
should be via the most expeditious means of suitable convenience. Global Patient Movement Requirements  Center  (GPMRC)  will  assist.  Categorize  the  patient  as  urgent  or  priority.  
Patients are then assigned or attached as described in Attachment 22 and Attachment 23. 4.73.  The Recovery Care Coordinator. 
4.73.1.  When  a  SM  has  an  injury  or  illness  that  makes  return  to  duty  unlikely,  he/she  is referred  to  a  Recovery  Care  Coordinator  (RCC).    Along  with  other  duties,  the  RCC  is 
responsible  for  facilitating  an  efficient,  effective  and  smooth  transition  from  the  initial treatment  phase  through  recovery,  rehabilitation  and  reintegration  back  into  a  military 
position or into ―civilian life‖ as a veteran.  The RCC collaborates with multidisciplinary Recovery Care Teams that include the Recovering SM‘s (RSM) unit commander, medical 
providers  and/or  resources,  medical  and  non-medical  case  managers,  military  personnel specialists, military family support specialists, VA Military Service Coordinators or liaisons, 
and the Federal Recovery Coordinator. 4.73.1.1.  The  Recovery  Coordination  Program  is  under  the  direction  of  the  Under 
Secretary  of  Defense  for  Personnel  and  Readiness.    The  fact  that  RCCs  are  often provided office space within the MTF should not be interpreted as meaning the RCC is 
assigned  to  the  Medical  Group.    The  placement  of  RCCs  within  the  MTF  is  a convenience for the RSM.  RCCs perform services in furtherance of personnel activities, 
not as a function of Treatment, Payment, or Healthcare Operations (TPO) on behalf of the MTF.  RCCs are not considered part of the AFMS, nor do they meet the definition of a 
Business Associate (BA). 4.73.1.2.  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  Training is  not 
required for RCC personnel in Air Force facilities. 4.73.1.3.  SMs may self-refer to the program, or be referred by their command or medical 
provider  after  medical  screening.  The  MTF  should  establish  procedures  to  verify  the identity  of  Recovering  Service  Members  participating  in  the  Recovery  Coordination 
Program.  It  is  imperative  that  MTFs  establish  effective  communication  processes  with local RCCs to ensure timely referrals of SMs who might benefit from the program‘s 
----------------Page (194) Break----------------
  196  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
services.   Healthcare providers and Medical Care Case Managers should  be well versed with  the  Recovery  Coordination  Program  and  understand  their  role  in  communicating 
with  the  RCC.    Conversely,  RCC  personnel  should  not  be  allowed  unfettered  access  to PHI,   or   otherwise   access/receive   PHI   pertaining   to   any   individual   not   directly 
participating in the Recovery Coordination Program. 4.73.1.4.  Disclosures  of  PHI  to  RCC  personnel  fall  under  the  category  of  Required  by 
Law, and must be properly documented in the Protected Health Information Management Tool (PHIMT) or the MTF‘s centralized disclosure accounting tool.  The Recovering SM 
(RSM) does not have to give his/her authorization for disclosure of the PHI as part of the initial  referral  process,  nor  is  permission  required  for  any  subsequent  disclosures  made 
throughout the duration of the RSM‘s participation in the program. RCC access to PHI is limited  to  service  members  participating  in  the  RCP,  therefore,  no  disclosure  of  PHI 
should occur beyond the service member‘s tenure in  the  program,  or  for  those  service members  who  decline  participation  in  the  program.  As  an  alternative  to  accounting  for 
each disclosure, MTFs  may use the recurring event provision found in DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph  C13.2.3  to  avoid  logging  each  disclosure.  MTF  Privacy  Officers  may  obtain 
additional information on proper use of this provision by contacting the HIPAA Support team at AFMOA. 
4.73.1.4.1.  The concept of ―minimum necessary‖ should always be appropriately applied  when  making  disclosures.  With  this  in  mind,  minimum  necessary  does  not 
apply to disclosures made pursuant to ―required by law‖, to the extent the disclosure complies with and is limited to the relevant requirements of the law. 
4.73.1.4.2.  As  applied  to  the Recovery  Coordination  Program,  DoDI  1300.24  offers no  specific  guidance  regarding  the  amount  or  types  of  information  RCCs  require  to 
perform  their  duties.    This  raises  the  potential  for  MTF  and  RCC  personnel  to  have differing  opinions.    When  situations  such  as  this  arise,  medical  personnel  should 
discuss  the  issues  with  the  RCC  to  determine  his/her  specific  needs,  then  exercise professional judgment in the disclosure of relevant information. 
4.73.2.  The primary tool used for coordinating the RSM‘s care as well as the RSM‘s family care, is the Comprehensive Recovery Plan (CRP) or Comprehensive Transition Plan (CTP). 
4.73.3.  While the Recovery Care Team develops a recovery plan, evaluates its effectiveness, and  adjusts  the  plan  when  medical  or  personal  transition  occurs,  it  is  the  RCC  who  makes 
sure the plan is complete and that it meets the RSM‘s and the family's needs and goals.  The RCC works with the unit commander and case managers to coordinate resources identified in 
the plan. 4.73.4.  PEBLOs should  develop  a  solid  partnership  with  the  RCC  assigned  to  their  MTF, 
location, or region. 4.74.  Temporary Disability Retired List. 
4.74.1.  Temporary  disability  retirement  occurs  when  a  SM  is  found  unfit  for  duty,  and subsequently entitled to disability retirement status, yet the SM‘s medical condition is not yet 
stable enough to ascertain whether the medical condition may improve or warrant permanent disability retirement status. 
----------------Page (195) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   197  
4.74.2.  Title 10, U.S.C. § 1210, requires reexamination of all members on the TDRL at least every  18  months  to  monitor  changes  in  the condition(s).    The  medical  facility  conducts  the 
examination  according  to  AFI  48-123.    HQ  AFPC/DPSD  usually  schedules  the  initial examination  16  months  after  placing  the  member  on  the  TDRL  so  the  medical  facility  can 
complete it before the end of the 18th month.  Exams are scheduled at the Air Force medical facility closest to the member‘s home with the required  capability, or the closest DoD 
medical  facility  if  indicated by the member‘s medical condition.  Extensive guidance is located  in  AFI  36-3212,  Chapter  7.    See  further  sponsor  service  affiliation  for  DEERS 
enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement in AFI 36-3026V1_IP. 4.74.3.  Procedures for Periodic Examinations. 
4.74.3.1.  Approximately 60 days prior to the reporting date, HQ AFPC/DPSD will send the previous TDRL medical records and instructions to the examining facility and request 
a TDRL medical appointment.  The MTF must respond within 10 days and provide date and time of the appointment.  If the medical facility cannot conduct the examination, they 
must return the records within 15 days to HQ AFPC/DPSDS.  The member shall provide to  the examining  physician, for  submission  to  the  PEB,  copies  of all  his  or her medical 
records  (civilian,  VA  and  all  military  medical  records) documenting  treatment  since  the last  examination.    If  the  member  fails  to  report  for  the  examination  on  the  scheduled 
reporting date, the medical facility must advise HQ AFPC/DPSDS immediately. 4.74.3.2.  The Commander of the examining facility or designated representative ensures 
the  examination  is  completed  as  quickly  as  possible.        The  DoD  requirement  is  to provide medical reports  to HQ AFPC/DPSD within 30 days of examination.  Ensure all 
laboratory  studies  and  consultations  have  been  completed  and  included  in  the  report.  Advise HQ AFPC/DPSD in writing of any delay and provide an estimated date of report 
completion. 4.74.3.3.  If  the  member  was  mentally incompetent  when  last  examined  and  there  has 
been  a  change  in  competency  since  then,  or  if  there  is  a  question  as  to  mental competency, the examining military facility must convene a competency board IAW AFI 
48-123. 4.74.3.4.  TDRL members who are imprisoned or confined by civil authorities must also 
have  a  periodic  examination.    HQ  AFPC/DPSD  requests  a  report  of  examination  and  a copy of the commitment order, when appropriate, from the confinement institution. 
4.74.4.  If a military retiree on the TDRL requires a mental competency status determination, it  will  be  accomplished  in  accordance  with  DFAS  DEM  177-373.  HQ  AFPC/DPSD  will 
designate an MTF to conduct this board along with the TDRL periodic evaluation. 4.74.5.  Travel   and   Per   Diem   Allowance.      SMs   traveling   to   a   medical   facility   for 
examination,  or  to  Lackland  AFB  TX  for  the  formal  PEB,  receive  travel  and  per  diem (including meals and lodging) allowance based on their retired grade (10 U.S.C. § 1210 and 
JFTR volume 1, Chapter 7, Part 1).  The SM is authorized an escort to accompany him or her to the place of examination only when the member is not physically or mentally able to travel 
without help. Approximately 20-30 days prior to the reporting date, HQ AFPC/DPSD sends travel orders to the member.  The order indicates the exact date, time and place to report and 
includes the authority for payment of travel costs.  The medical facility endorses the order to 
----------------Page (196) Break----------------
  198  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
verify whether they examined the SM as an inpatient or outpatient, as well as the dates and times  the  member  reported  and  was  released  after  completing  the  examination.    If  the 
examination  was  in  outpatient  status,  indicate  whether  the  member  occupied  government quarters.    The  examining  facility  must  ensure  the  SM  has  an  indorsed order  to  submit  the 
claim  for  reimbursement.    The  SM  submits  a  travel  voucher  to  902  CPTS/FMFC  for reimbursement.    Reference  the  Joint  Federal  Travel  Regulation  (JFTR)  for  further  travel 
entitlement information. 4.75.  Reserve  Component  and  Reserve  Command  Surgeon  or  Air  Surgeon.  For  Reserve 
Component  (RC)  personnel,  the  RC/SGP  is  the  approval  authority  for  ALC-C,  Medical  Hold decisions,  and  non-emergent  surgery  requests  within  final  six  months  of  service.    Active  Duty 
MTFs should contact the appropriate RC/SGP when confronted with these issues involving RC personnel.    For  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  personnel,  ANG/DP  is  the  approval  authority  for 
ALC-C,  Medical  Hold,  and  non-emergent  surgery.    The  ANG/SGP  office  will  work  in conjunction with ANG/DP when confronted with these issues involving ANG personnel. 
4.75.1.  Procedures  for  Reserve  Component  (RC)  SMs.    Medical  Evaluation  Boards  for RCSMs entitled to disability evaluation processing shall be convened at Active Duty MTFs.  
Refer  to  AFI 36-3026V1_IP  for  further  sponsor  service  affiliation  for  DEERS  enrollment, eligibility, and medical entitlement. 
4.75.1.1.  Determining Eligibility and Pre-MEB Case Processing.  MEB initiation or case processing cannot begin for any RCSM without a properly completed AFRC Form 348, 
Informal Line of Duty Determination, AF Form 348, Line of Duty Determination, or DD Form 261, Investigation, Report of – Line of Duty and Misconduct Status.  Whenever a 
RCSM  is  referred  for  an  MEB,  the  PEBLO  will  establish  contact  with  the  medical  Air Reserve  Technician  (ART)  or  Air  National  Guard  Fulltime  Point  of  Contact  at  the 
RCSM‘s supporting RCMU.   For IMA personnel, the Base Individual Mobilization Augmentee  Administrator  (BIMAA)  or    RMG/IRMS  will  be  contacted.    The  medical 
ART, Air National Guard Fulltime Point of Contact or BIMAA will assist the PEBLO in confirming the member‘s eligibility for medical care and provide general administrative 
support  (for  any  required  action  specifically  related  to  RC  pre-MEB  action,  to  include arrangements  of  any  medical  TDY).    The  medical  ART,  Air  National  Guard  Fulltime 
Point of Contact, or BIMAA and PEBLO will maintain contact with the RCSM to obtain all required documents and arrange for medical TDY.  The PEBLO will notify the ART, 
Air National Guard Fulltime Point of Contact or BIMAA prior to initiating the MEB.  If the PEBLO is unable to contact the medical ART, Air National Guard Fulltime Point of 
Contact, or BIMAA, the PEBLO shall contact the respective RC Command level Medical Support (SG) or Aerospace Medicine (SGP) office for assistance. 
4.75.1.2.  Line of Duty.  A completed AFRC Form 348, AF Form 348, or DD Form 261 with an ―In Line of Duty‖ determination is required before any RCSMs can be considered 
for  disability  consideration.    If  the  necessary  LOD  determination  form  is  not  in  the medical records, or if the LOD determination is unclear or confusing, the RCSM will be 
referred to his or her supporting RC medical facility for LOD review.  After entitlement to disability processing has been established, only the medical diagnoses (resulting from 
known actions, events, origin, or etiology) determined to be ―In Line of Duty‖ following completion of the AFRC Form 348, AF Form 348, or DD Form 261, shall be identified 
on the AF Form 618 as the reason for MEB processing. 
----------------Page (197) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   199  
4.75.1.3.  The appropriate administrative LOD representative at the RCSM‘s unit must contact  the  MMSO  and  inform  the  service  office  that  the  RCSM  has  been  referred  for 
MEB  review.    The  unit  LOD  representative  will  also  furnish  a  completed  copy  of  the LOD report to the MMSO. 
4.75.1.4.  Medical  Records  on  RCSMs  undergoing  MEB  or  RILO  of  MEB  will  be forwarded along with the MEB report, supporting documentation, and the following: 
4.75.1.5.  A copy of the orders or other directives placing a member in a duty status at the time of onset of illness, injury, or disease. 
4.75.1.6.  A  completed  and  signed  copy  of  the  AFRC  Form  348,  AF  Form  348,  or  DD Form 261, as appropriate. 
4.75.1.7.  Medical documentation and medical information unique to Reserve personnel. 4.75.1.8.  Expedited   Processing   of   Reserve   Component   Medical   Evaluation   Board 
Continuation Cases at 59th Medical Wing. 4.75.1.8.1.  Reserve Component members who are injured or become ill while on US 
Code,  Title  10  military  orders  are  eligible  for  Medical  Continuation  (MEDCON) orders while receiving treatment for their condition.  During the treatment process, it 
may be determined that the RCSM requires an MEB.  It is at this time that the MTF historically  responsible  for  providing  the  majority  of  medical  support  to  the  RC 
military unit, was generally responsible for processing the MEB. 4.75.1.8.1.1.  The  objective  of  MEDCON  is  to  enhance  utilization  and  readiness 
of personnel while preserving their health and preventing further injury or illness. MEDCON  extends  active  duty  for  RCSMs  when  further  medical  evaluation  is 
warranted,  as  set  forth  in  AFI  48-123.    Refer  to  SAF/MR  Memorandum  on Medical Continuation for Air Reserve Component (ARC) Members, 9 Dec 2011 
for information regarding policy, responsibilities, and procedures  for authorizing MEDCON orders. 
4.75.1.8.2.  Processing RC MEB cases can prove to be difficult at MTFs with limited direct  care  capabilities  or  limited  TRICARE  network  medical  specialty  availability.  
In an effort to alleviate caseload build-up at the MTF due to these limitations, some select RC MEB case processing may shift from the primary MTF to the 59th Medical 
Wing.    Medical  centers,  hospitals,  and  clinics  with  the  necessary  medical  capability and  available  TRICARE  network  specialties,  within  a  reasonable  distance  from  the 
MTF, will be expected to continue the MEB process locally. 4.75.1.8.3.  The criteria established for expedited processing of Medical Continuation 
cases at the 59th Medical Wing are as follows: 4.75.1.8.3.1.  Cases  identified  for  imminent  MEB  processing  AAC  37  personnel 
status – with completed Line of Duty determination). 4.75.1.8.3.2.  Medical/surgical   specialty   appointment(s)   required   either   not 
available at the local MTF or within a reasonable one day‘s travel (by automobile) at a TRICARE network provider. 
4.75.1.8.3.3.  Mental  health  appointment(s)  required  either  not  available  at  the 
----------------Page (198) Break----------------
  200  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
local MTF or within a reasonable one day‘s travel (by automobile) at a TRICARE network provider. 
4.75.1.8.4.  Reserve  Component  personnel  with  significant  medical  conditions  that require  persistent  clinical  care  may  be  attached,  never  assigned,  to  an  MTF  Patient 
Squadron during MEB processing. 4.75.1.8.5.  The MTF Commander will notify the appropriate RC Command Surgeon 
when an MEB is required for a RC flag officer. 4.75.1.8.6.  Appropriate RC/SGP:

4.75.1.8.7.  Air  Force  Reserve  members  not  entitled  to  disability  processing  will  be evaluated IAW AFI 48-123 and AFRC medical policy guidance. Air National Guard 
members not entitled to disability processing will be evaluated IAW AFI 48-123 and ANG  medical  policy  guidance.    For  mission  purposes,  commanders  and  their 
designees, to include personnel offices, must receive medical information.  Only the minimum necessary will be provided.  If disclosures of this information have not been 
previously  authorized  by  the  SM,  the  MTF  will  account  for  the  disclosures  in accordance with DoD 6025.18-R. 
4.76.  Assignment Limitation Code-C. 4.76.1.  Definition.  When an active duty member has been returned to duty by the Air Force 
DES  as  fit,  DPAMM  will  review  the  case  to  determine  if  an  Assignment  Limitation  Code (ALC)-C needs to be placed in the Personnel Data System (PDS).  This action is taken by the 
appropriate  ARC/SGP  when  the  member  is  an  RCSM.    This  code  restricts  assignment  and deployment availability to only CONUS, Alaska (Elmendorf), and Hawaii assignments, and 
will  prevent  reassignment  anywhere  else  without  prior  approval  by  designated  approval authorities described in  detail further in this section.  The intent of the ALC-C is to protect 
members from being placed in an environment where they may not receive adequate medical care for a possible life-threatening medical condition and to prevent the assignment of non-
----------------Page (199) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   201  
qualified  personnel  to  overseas  locations.    This  will  further  ensure  the  safe  and  effective accomplishment of the Air Force mission. 
4.76.2.  Authority.  HQ AFPC/DPAMM retains sole authority to assign or remove the ALC-C  on  active  duty  members, while  the  ARC/SGP  is  the  authority  to  assign  or  remove  the 
ALC-C or DAC-42 for RCSMs. 4.76.2.1.  DPAMM (or the appropriate ARC authority) may assign the following ALC-C 
codes  based  on  risk  and  medical  requirement.    The  code  will  be  valid  indefinitely,  but should be reviewed or renewed at least annually unless otherwise specified by DPAMM 
or the ARC/SGP. 4.76.2.1.1.  ALC-C1  This  code  will  be  used  primarily  to  identify  individuals  with 
temporary  or  mild  conditions  requiring  medical  follow-up  but  whose  condition  is clinically  quiescent  or  unlikely  to  cause  serious  impact  if  untreated  or  treatment  is 
limited to primary care during periods of deployment or assignment. 4.76.2.1.2.  ALC-C2  This  ALC-C  will  be  used  for  medical  conditions  for  which 
specialist  medical  care  and  referral  within  one  year  is  likely  but  who  could  be deployed  or  reassigned  OCONUS  or  to  non-fixed  environments  if  appropriate 
specialty care is available, or for short periods of time. 4.76.2.1.3.  ALC-C3  This  ALC-C stratification  designates  members  who  should  not 
be deployed or assigned  away  from specialty medical capability  required  to manage their unique medical condition. 
4.76.2.2.  Officials  at  DPAMM  (or  ARC/SGP)  will  stratify  ADSMs  during  each  annual RILO review. 
4.76.2.3.  Active Duty and RC medical facility Commanders are responsible for tracking and keeping Wing Commanders updated on those members of the command who are on 
ALC-C or DAC-42 and will assure timely medical review as specified by DPAMM or the appropriate  ARC/SGP  during  the   year  indicated.    Medical  reviews  are  conducted 
periodically, as specified by the appropriate authority, depending on the diagnosis. 4.76.3.  Requests  to  Allow Deployment  or  Overseas  Assignment  or  deployment  for  Airmen 
with ALC-C Limitations.  The ALC-C is NOT designed to limit deployment and/or overseas assignments.    It  is  designed  to  ensure  that  members  with  medical  conditions  are  assigned 
and/or deployed to the appropriate location where care is available.  This requires that waiver coordination  between  the  losing  base  and  the  medical  waiver  approval  authority  occur  in  a 
timely manner. 4.76.3.1.  Initiation of Waiver Requests.  When a SM who carries an ALC-C restriction is 
notified of an overseas PCS or deployment, the member's garrison MTF must initiate and process  an  ALC-C  waiver  request  in  an  expeditious  manner.    The  MTF  may  become 
aware  of  the member's  selection  for  deployment/PCS  via notification  from  the member, the  member's  commander,  the  MPS,  Force  Health  Management,  Medical  Readiness,  or 
other  source.    It  is  recommended  that  Force  Health  Management  or  equivalent  point  of contact  in  the  MTF  validate  the  possible  overseas  assignment  with  an  official  source 
(e.g.,  the  member's  unit  First  Sergeant  or  deployment  manager)  to  avoid  unnecessary 
----------------Page (200) Break----------------
  202  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
processing   of   waivers.   The   waiver   review   package   should   contain   the   following information: 
4.76.3.1.1.  The most recent RILO narrative. 4.76.3.1.2.  A   current   AF   Form   469   with   all   duty   and   deployment   limitations 
reviewed/validated within the last 30 days. 4.76.3.1.3.  The most recent medical record entry (typically  from AHLTA or similar 
electronic system) that addresses the condition for which the SM was issued an ALC-C.  If the most recent medical record entry is greater than 30 days old, the PCM will 
add  an  addendum  to  the  most  recent  note  updating  the  member's  currently  known clinical  status,  to  include  any  specialty  consults  or  laboratory  or  radiology  study 
results since the medical record entry (copies of these results may be included).  Such results should include routine maintenance testing (e.g., HgbA1C values for diabetics; 
the most  recent  Peak  Flow,  spirometry,  and/or  pulmonary  function  tests  for  asthma; etc).      The  PCM  should  include  an  assessment  of  the  stability  of  the  condition,  any 
need  for  clinical  follow-up  or  testing,  and  the  impact  of  the  condition  upon  the member's  duty  performance  and  ability  to  meet  deployment  criteria.    If  there  have 
been no changes or updates of any manner, the provider may indicate this fact in the addendum.    A  clinical  encounter  with  the  PCM  is  not  required,  but  may  be 
accomplished within the 10-day window if the PCM feels it is indicated. 4.76.3.1.4.  A   memo,   cover   letter,   or   appropriate   transmission   that   includes 
information   on   the   assignment,   such   as   projected   departure   date,   duration   of assignment,  and  location  of  assignment  (with  appropriate  management  of  classified 
information).    For  example,  for  deployments,  inclusion  of  the  Unit  Line Number (ULN) will allow the waiver authority to specifically assess the deployed assignment. 
4.76.3.2.  Within 10 duty days of MTF notification of the assignment, the waiver review package  will  be  forwarded  to  the  appropriate  waiver  authority.  If  it  is  determined  that 
additional  testing  or  evaluation  is  required  to  fully  assess  the  SM's  ability  to  meet  the assignment  requirements,  the  package  may  be  delayed  for  an  additional  10  duty  days, 
upon  approval  of  the  SGH  or  SGP,  in  order  to  accomplish  these clinical  evaluations.  However,  if  obtaining  these  additional  evaluations  will  take  longer  than  20  total  days 
from  initial  assignment  notification,  the  waiver  package  will  be  sent  to  the  waiver authority within the first 10 days of initial notification with an explanation of how long it 
is projected for the evaluations to be completed. 4.76.3.2.1.  If the member is being  followed by  specialists, the most recent specialty 
note  should  also  be  included,  if  not  fully  detailed  in  the  RILO.  Do  not  delay in sending  the  waiver  request  to  the  waiver  authority  in  order  to  update  or  repeat  a 
specialty consultation, if there has been no change in the member‘s condition since the last consult.  If it has been determined by the PCM that the member‘s condition is 
of  questionable  stability,  and  requires  a  new  specialty  consult  in  order  to  assess  the condition, the package can be delayed up to ten (10) additional duty days before it is 
submitted to the waiver authority, but only with approval from the SGP or SGH. The PCM will notify the PEBLO, who will work with the TOPA office to ensure that the 
member‘s  consult  for  deployment  clearance  is  expedited.  Approvals  for  delayed (greater than 10 duty days) ALC-C waiver request submissions must be documented 
----------------Page (201) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   203  
in  the  DAWG  minutes,  and  for  any  delayed  waiver  request,  the  time  from  initial request,  to  submission  to  the  waiver  approval  authority,  must  be  tracked  by  the 
DAWG. Any time submission of a waiver request exceeds 20 (twenty) duty days, the PEBLO must contact (1) the office that initiated the waiver request and (2) the SMs 
commander, to inform them of the delay in processing the waiver. 4.76.3.3.  Waivers  for   Members  with  ALC-C1  Stratifications.    All  ALC-C  waiver 
requests will be documented in the next DAWG meeting with explanations of any delays in  processing.    However,  it  is  not  necessary  to  delay  processing  a  waiver  package  until 
the next DAWG meeting.  This will allow the DAWG to monitor trends in this process. 4.76.3.3.1.  ALC-C1:  Deployable/Assignable  to  Global  DoD  fixed  facilities  with 
intrinsic  Medical  Treatment  Facilities  (except  for  the  locations  listed  in  4.76.3.3.2), without  an  ALC-C waiver.  For a list of ―fixed MTFs‖, refer to the AFPC Medical 
Retention   Standards   Branch   page   of   the   AFMS   Knowledge Exchange   [go   to Headquarters ViewMoreOtherAFPC Medical Retention Standards]. 
4.76.3.3.2.  ALC-C1  requires  a  waiver  for  PCS,  Deployment  or  TDY  to  any  of  our isolated or remote installations overseas, including bases at Soto Cano, Moron, Diego 
Garcia, Thule, Al Udeid, Izmir, etc. Lajes Field, Eielson AFB, and the installations in Korea also fall into this category; even though these bases may have ―fixed MTFs,‖ 
these   locations   are   considered   to   be   particularly   remote   and/or   are   generally considered to be ―deployed‖ installations.  Airmen with an ALC-C1 identifier require 
a waiver to be assigned. 4.76.3.3.3.  ALC-C1 does NOT require a waiver for PCS/TDY to other ―fixed bases‖ 
like those in Germany, England, Japan, Guam, or Italy, or to Elmendorf or Hickam. 4.76.3.3.4.  The  waiver  approval  authority  for  Airmen  with  ALC-C1  is  usually  the 
gaining  MTF  Commander  (may  be  delegated  to  SGH  or  SGP).    If  no  MTF  is  co-located, the gaining MAJCOM or COCOM command surgeon is the waiver authority.  
Note: The waiver approval authority for all PCS, Deployment and TDY to Southwest Asia is the AFCENT command surgeon‘s office, not the specific gaining MTF. 
4.76.3.4.  Waivers  for  Members  with  ALC-C2  Stratifications.    Waiver  authorities  may approve or  deny  the  waiver  upon  receipt  of  the  initial  waiver  review  package,  or  they 
may  agree  to  wait  for  the  additional  clinical  information.    Additionally,  the  waiver authority  may  direct  additional  information  (e.g.,  a  new/updated  RILO  review  by 
DPAMM).  The MTF should make every effort to keep the member's unit (Commander, First Sergeant, or Unit Deployment Manager, for example) updated on the progress of the 
waiver  package,  particularly  estimates  on  completion  of  any  additional  requirements  of the waiver authority. 
4.76.3.4.1.  ALC-C2:    Deployable/Assignable  to  CONUS  installations  with  intrinsic fixed MTFs (TRICARE Network availability assumed) without a waiver, but requires 
a waiver for PCS, Deployment or TDY anywhere overseas. 4.76.3.4.2.  ALC-C2  does  not  require  a  waiver  for  Elmendorf  or  Hickam  Air  Force 
Base assignments. 
----------------Page (202) Break----------------
  204  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
4.76.3.4.3.  The  Waiver  Approval  Authority  for  those  with  ALC-C2  is  the  gaining MAJCOM or COCOM command surgeon (may be delegated to MAJCOM/COCOM 
SGH or SGP). 4.76.3.5.  Waivers for Members with ALC-C3 Stratifications. 
4.76.3.5.1.  ALC-C3:  Limited  to  duty  at  specific  CONUS  installations,  as  well  as Elmendorf or Hickam Air Force Bases, based on medical need.  Requires a waiver for 
PCS, Deployment, or TDY anywhere else overseas. 4.76.3.5.2.  The   Waiver   Approval   Authority   for   those   with   ALC-C3   is   HQ 
AFPC/DPAMM,  550  C  Street  West,  Suite  26,  Randolph  AFB,  TX  81150-4718  (for active  duty  members)  or  appropriate  RC/SGP  (for  Air  National  Guard  or  Air  Force 
Reserve Command). 4.76.3.5.2.1.  Special Requirements for ALC-C3 Waiver Packages.  In addition to 
the requirements for ALC-C waiver packages noted above in paragraph 4.76.3.2, there  are  special  requirements  for  those  with  ALC-C3.    Because  ALC-C3  is 
assigned to Airmen with unique conditions, waivers of ALC-C3 are only granted when  the  benefit  of  deploying  or  assigning  the  member  overseas  outweighs  the 
potential  risks.    The  waiver  request  must  be  in  the  form  of  a  memorandum, written   or   endorsed,   by   a   General   Officer,   Wing   Commander,   or   civilian 
equivalent,  preferably  from  the  gaining  command.    It  should  indicate  that  the commander is aware of the member‘s ALC-C, and that despite this, the SM is the 
best one qualified and available for the job, essential for mission accomplishment, and  that  the  member  will  not  be  forward-deployed  from  the  gaining  location 
(unless another waiver is submitted).  The memo must also state that care for the member‘s  condition  has  been  coordinated  with  the  gaining  MTF  and 
MAJCOM/COCOM  command  surgeons.    A  corroborating  statement  from  the gaining SG, indicating that care is available to meet the member‘s needs, is also 
required. 4.76.4.  Medical  Treatment  Facility  Action  for  Return  to  Duty  with  an  ALC-C.    The  MTF 
will complete an AF Form 469 appropriate for the SM‘s current condition and C-code stratification. 
4.76.4.1.  ALC-C1: 4.76.4.1.1.  Worldwide (mobility) qualified will be marked ―YES.‖ 
4.76.4.1.2.  The release date will be dashed or left blank. 4.76.4.1.3.  The ―Remarks‖ section will contain the phrase ―SM has been found fit 
and was returned to duty with the following restrictions:  Member may be assigned or deployed only to DoD facilities with fixed medical treatment facilities.  Member may 
be  assigned  to  a  mobility  position.    The  gaining  MTF  or  MAJCOM  SGH  or  SGP must approve exceptions to this restriction in writing.  The appropriate RC/SGP must 
coordinate  on  all  Palace  Chase/Front  assignment  actions  into  the  RC  prior  to  final approval.  This ALC-C must be reviewed by DPAMM periodically.  Submit a RILO

Section 4L—Tumor Registry Program Administration 
4.77.  The Tumor Registry Program. 4.77.1.  All Air Force MTFs that diagnose and/or treat patients with malignancies must have 
a  cancer  program  and  will  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  American  College  of Surgeons‘ Committee (ACS) on Cancer, IAW AFI 44-110, The Cancer Program to the extent 
possible based on the size and services of the facility.  The guidance in this chapter applies to patient administration only if the MTF is not authorized its own histopathology department. 
4.77.2.  At   a   minimum,   cancer   programs   in   MTFs   must   have   an   institutional   cancer committee,  a  tumor  registry  and  hold  timely  cancer  conferences/Tumor  Board  meetings.  
Small MTFs (free-standing clinics and  hospitals of fewer than 15 beds) may use the cancer 
----------------Page (204) Break----------------
  206  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
programs  and  the  registry  functions  of  a  larger  referral  MTF.    Establish  a  memorandum  of agreement  (MOA)  or  other  comparable  written  agreement  to  define  roles,  responsibilities, 
and  expectations  between  each  MTF.    If  an  agreement  exists,  the smaller,  dependent  MTF, must  still  continue  to  perform  case  finding  and  prevention  activities.    Additionally,  when 
another larger MTF assumes this responsibility, the dependent MTF must continue to provide necessary coordination and support as required. 
4.77.3.  The  Tumor  Registry  is  the  principal  database  for  evaluating  the  care  of  cancer patients  in  the  MTF.    All  MTFs  that  diagnose  and/or  treat  cancer must  maintain a  registry.  
Patient Administration actions will include: 4.77.3.1.  Use Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR) to create and track cases. 
4.77.3.2.  Maintain  follow-up  information  for  the  lifetime  of  each  patient  according  to ACS guidelines.

Chapter 5 
HEALTH RECORDS MANAGEMENT 
Section 5A—General Program Administration 
5.1.  Managing Health Records. 5.1.1.  Health  records  are  the  property  of  the  United  States  Government,  not  the  individual 
beneficiary.    This  designated  record  set  consists  of  electronic  health  records,  outpatient records,  inpatient  records,  extended  ambulatory  records  (EAR),  fetal  monitoring  strips 
(FMS),  mental  health  records,  dental  records,  obstetrical  and  gynecological  (pre  and  post partum records), radiographic images and film, and any other official record or media format 
(physical,  analog,  digital,  video)  that  provides  a  permanent  record  of  a  patient‘s medical/dental  care.    Maintenance  of  records  at  the  MTF  is  required  IAW  this  Air  Force 
instruction.    Refer  to  Army  Regulation  (AR)  40-66,  Medical  Record  Administration  and Healthcare Documentation   for   additional   information   on   US   Army   health   records 
maintenance.      Refer   to   Navy   Manual   NAVMED   P-117,   Chapter   16,   for   additional information  on  health  records  maintenance  of  Navy  personnel.    Inform  beneficiaries  of  this 
requirement through appropriate media. Initiate action to retrieve records maintained outside the MTF.  Regardless of the status of the individual, if the beneficiary is enrolled to the MTF, 
it is mandatory that their health records will be maintained in the MTF of enrollment. 5.1.2.  Management of medical records includes ―assurance‖ which is the responsibility of 
administrative, clinical, and information technology staff. 5.1.3.  The MTF Commander is the Custodian of Records and ensures that all health records 
are  prepared,  maintained,  used,  protected,  and  controlled  as  required  IAW  this  instruction.  The  Commander  also  ensures  that  records  and  loose  documents  are  retired  or  disposed  of 
according  to  the  Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System,  (AFRIMS), and Records Disposition Schedule.  Commanders must be knowledgeable concerning the control 
of  health  records  and  PHI,  release  of  information  from  the  records,  and  provider  of  care documentation   requirements.      Commanders   ensure   that   these   important   functions   are 
properly  supported.  The  MTF  Commander  manages  custody  and  control  security  assurance of paper-based and automated/electronic medical records. 
5.1.4.  The  Dental  Squadron  Commander  or  MTF  Dental  Surgeon  is  the  custodian  of  the dental  records and  is  responsible  to  the  MTF  Commander  for  dental  record  management 
functions    including    custody    and    control    security    assurance    of    paper-based    and automated/electronic medical records. 
5.1.5.  The RHIA/RHIT or Air Force member equivalent is responsible for the management of inpatient records to include the coding of inpatient and Ambulatory Procedure Visit (APV) 
records,  management  of  medical  transcription,  and  also  provides  oversight  for  outpatient record documentation and coding of patient encounters and professional services provided on 
inpatient episodes.  The RHIA or RHIT works closely with the Information System Security Office  (ISSO)  and  Privacy  Officer  to  ensure  security  of  and  controlled  access  to  both  the 
paper-based and automated medical records, and to ensure release of information procedures conform to all legal requirements. 
----------------Page (206) Break----------------
  208  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.1.6.  Healthcare providers (physicians, dentists, and other authorized healthcare providers) will  include  in  appropriate  health  records,  an  accurate,  legible,  and  complete  description  of 
all services rendered to patients.  This description must adequately  address current medical, administrative,   and   legal   requirements.      Healthcare   providers   will   ensure   that   proper 
identification  information  is  entered  on  various  forms  and  that  records  are  returned  to  the appropriate file as quickly as practical, but NLT 72 hours after treatment is rendered. 
5.1.7.  Records  created  and  maintained  at  a  joint  Department  of  Defense/Veterans  Affairs (DoD/VA) facility are shared by the two organizations.  Develop local policies to ensure that 
the needs of both organizations are met.  Records disposition instructions can be found at the AFRIMS  Records  Disposition  Schedule,  Series  41  Internet  website,  accessible  via  the  Air 
Force  Portal  website,  the  Medical  Record  Tracking,  Retirement  and  Retrieval  (MRTR2) System Internet website located at the AFMS Knowledge Exchange, and further along in this 
same section. 5.2.  Documenting Health Records.  Health records are completed to meet the highest possible 
standards   of   completeness,   promptness,   clinical   pertinence,   and   standards   of   the   Joint Commission  and  the  Accreditation  Association  for  Ambulatory  Healthcare  (AAAHC).    Only 
authorized  individuals  make  entries  in  the  medical  record  using  black  or  blue-black  ink.    No other  annotations  are  authorized.    Dental  records  are  the  responsibility  of  the  base  dental 
surgeon.    See  AFI  47-101,  Managing  Air  Force  Dental  Services,  for  maintenance  of  dental records.    For  care  received  outside  of  the  Direct  Care  System  ensure  that  Memorandum  of 
Understanding    (MOU)    and    TRICARE    contracts    include    a    mechanism    for    obtaining documentation (i.e., summaries, operative reports, etc) to be incorporated into the individual‘s 
health record. 5.3.  Correcting Health Records. 
5.3.1.  Patients  have  the  right,  under  HIPAA,  to  access  their  health  records  and  request amendment  if  they  think  the  documentation  is  in  error.    However,  there  is  no  MTF 
requirement  to  agree  to  the  proposed  amendment.    Furthermore,  at  no  time  should  any documentation  be  removed  from  the  record  (including  automated  record  documentation 
systems)  unless  it  is  determined  that  the  documentation  does  not  pertain  to  the  patient  in question or any one of the following two scenarios applies: 
5.3.1.1.  Records or PCM support staff may remove an out-dated DD Form 2766C, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet as long as the most current version of this form 
documents the latest immunization history for the patient. 5.3.1.2.  Outdated or expired recommendations for special operations and/or flying status 
in accordance with Attachment 11 for AF Form 1042 an AF Form 1418. 5.3.2.  The request to amend the record must be made in writing and be signed by the patient 
or guardian and filed in section 3 of AF Form 2100A or left side of AF Form 2100. 5.3.3.  Reply to the requestor, in writing, within 30 days with either an acceptance or denial 
of the amendment.  If this is not possible, a 30-day extension is allowed.  However, the MTF will inform the patient, in writing, about the extension.  The letter will include a reason for 
the  delay  and  a  date  the  response  will  be  provided.    Only  one  extension  is  allowed  per amendment request. 
----------------Page (207) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   209  
5.3.4.  Denial of requests is allowed if any of the following conditions are met: 5.3.4.1.  The  PHI  is  not  part  of  a  designated  record  set  available  for  inspection  under 
HIPAA. 5.3.4.2.  The information requested to be amended is accurate and complete. 
5.3.4.3.  The  MTF  did  not  originally  create  the  PHI  requested  for  amendment  (e.g., copies of records from treatment at another MTF or civilian facility provider).  However, 
if the requestor can prove that the MTF that originally created the information no longer exists, the MTF will handle the request as if it had created the information. 
5.3.5.  Upon  receipt  of  a  request  for  record  amendment,  forward  it  immediately  to  the applicable provider for research. 
5.3.6.  Take  the  following  action  when  an  error  is  identified  near  in  time  to  the  erroneous entry date and the responsible practitioner has current memory of the circumstances. 
5.3.6.1.  Line through the incorrect data with one straight line.  Do not erase, scratch out or otherwise destroy the original data.  Amendment of erroneous data should be done by 
the initial provider/practitioner.  If that is impractical, enter a brief explanation of why the originating provider did not make the correction.  Enter the correct data next to the lined 
through data if space permits.  Only privileged providers, authorized to document patient care, will make corrections.  Each supplemental or corrected entry must be dated, signed 
and stamped. 5.3.6.2.  If there is not enough space on the record next to the incorrect data to enter the 
correction, draw one straight line through the entry, initial, date and make a referral note to  where  in  the  record  the  correction  is  documented.    Then  enter  the  correction 
chronologically as indicated on the referral note.  If the correction is not self-explanatory, also enter the reason for the correction.  Provider will sign, date, and stamp the new entry.  
If other practitioners are associated with the patient‘s care and have a need-to-know concerning  the change,  inform  them  of  the  correction.    Major  changes  may  require 
documentation on a separate form (i.e., a new, blank form).  Follow the same procedures stated  above  and  file  the  corrected  information  as  near  as  possible  to  the  document 
containing the lined through information. 5.3.7.  If  an  error  is  identified  after  a  claim  or  lawsuit  has  been  filed  or  after  a  substantial 
lapse,  then  the  provider  with  personal  knowledge  of  the  erroneous  data  must  consult  Air Force  legal  counsel  prior  to  correcting  an  erroneous  entry  in  accordance  with  paragraphs 
5.3.6.1.  and  5.3.6.2.  The  provider  with  personal  knowledge  of  the  erroneous  data  should immediately notify all practitioners involved with the patient‘s care. 
5.3.8.  Patients  who  believe  their  medical  records  contain  erroneous  entries  or  information have  several  options  to  remedy  perceived  errors.    Several  laws  and  regulations,  such  as  5 
U.S.C.  §  552a  and  AFI  33-332,  Air  Force  Privacy  Program  and  AFI  36-2603,  Air  Force Board  for  Correction  of  Military  Records,  allow  patients  to  seek  relief  when  they  believe 
their medical records should be amended and the MTF has denied their requests.  If a patient files such a request to the Air Force Board of Correction of Military Records, SAF/MRBR, 
550 C Street West, Suite 40, Randolph AFB TX  78150-4742, the MTF will take no action until  contacted  by  the  board  representatives.    See  AFPAM  36-2607,  Guide  to  Processing 
----------------Page (208) Break----------------
  210  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
Applications  to  the  Air  Force  Board  for  Correction  of  Military  Records  (AFBCMR)  for further guidance and AFI 36-2603 Chapter 3 for application procedures and who may apply.  
If there are questions regarding an amendment, contact the SJA or area MLC. 5.3.9.  Legal correction of erroneous data or information in the electronic health record of a 
patient  encounter.    Since  these  legal  corrections  of  erroneous  data  may  involve  sensitive situations  and  require  Tier  III  Help  Desk  Support,  TRICARE  Management  Activity  has 
developed  a  specific  process  to  request  the  legal  correction  of  erroneous  PHI.    Refer  to Attachment 15, Correction of AHLTA Erroneous Data or Information. 
5.3.10.  All provider SSNs must be redacted so as to be unreadable prior to issuing a copy of any  health  record  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  outpatient  medical,  dental  treatment, 
inpatient,  ambulatory  procedure  visit,  and  extended  ambulatory  record).    Specifically,  the MTF will make an initial copy of the record(s), then within the copy, sanitize the entire SSN, 
and  then  recopy  the  health  record(s)  before  releasing  a  copy to  the  requestor.    This  policy applies to copies for any purpose, to include individual‘s requesting copies of his/her own 
records  for  any  reason.    Original  medical  records  should  remain  intact.    The  original providers SSN must never be deleted from the original health record. 
5.4.  The Electronic Health Record. 5.4.1.  The Air Force Medical Service has transitioned much of its day-to-day outpatient care 
documentation processes into AHLTA; the DoD‘s approved EHR.  Until we completely transition to an electronic health record, the AFMS will use a ―hybrid‖ record consisting 
primarily of the EHR and including traditional paper-based records and forms to meet unique operational mission requirements. 
5.4.2.  The following applications are the only approved electronic health record applications authorized for use within the Air Force Medical Service: 
5.4.2.1.  AHLTA and CHCS – outpatient medical and dental care which is stored in the Central Data Repositories (CDR). 
5.4.2.2.  Essentris - inpatient  medical  care  which  is  stored  in  the  MTF  Global  Data Repositories (GDR). 
5.4.2.3.  Composite Healthcare System II-Theater (AHLTA-T). 5.4.3.  Medical  Systems  and  Applications  Not  Considered  Part  of  the  Official  Air  Force 
Medical System Electronic Health Record: 5.4.3.1.  Acquisition, deployment, and use of other electronic health record applications, 
systems,   or   components   (separate   from   the   systems   mentioned   in   the   preceding paragraph)  to  temporarily  or  permanently  document  patient  healthcare  is  prohibited 
unless  approved  by  the  Assistant  Surgeon  General,  Health  Care  Operations,  Deputy  or USAF  Surgeon  General,  or  when  directed  by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of 
Defense,  Health  Affairs.    Any  non-AFMS  or  non-MHS  standardized  electronic  system, application,  or  clinical  management  tool  that  does  not  provide  for  the  permanent 
transferability  of  electronically  generated  or  documented  health  information  into  the MHS Central Data Repository, individual or regional MTF inpatient GDR, MHS or Air 
Force  standardized  and  approved  data  repository  or  database,  and/or  official  Veteran Affairs  single  medical  data  repository,  is  not  considered  part  of  the  official  Air  Force 
----------------Page (209) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   211  
EHR.  If the clinical information and/or PHI contained therein is meant to be permanently stored or may possibly be relied upon in the future to support the delivery of healthcare, 
then  all  PHI  must  be  immediately  transferred  to  an  approved  EHR  or  standardized  and AF/SG  approved  data  repository  or  printed and filed into the patient‘s paper medical 
record. 5.4.4.  MTF  Commanders  may  require  that  all  or  some  of  the  medical  records  maintained 
within the MTF may be filed in hard copy format, regardless of electronic record capabilities, to  fulfill  mission  requirements  and  to  ensure  comprehensive  continuity  of  care.    MTF 
Commanders must be knowledgeable of health record management practices as they apply to members assigned to the following critical programs: 
5.4.5.  EHR  Use  and  Documentation for  Members  Assigned  to  Sensitive  Duties  Programs:  Service  Members  assigned  to  Sensitive  Duties  Programs,  like  the  PRP,  PSP,  or  other 
sensitive duty National Security program(s), may be temporarily or permanently decertified, suspended, or removed from their duty position(s) based on their medical, dental, or mental 
health   status   or   the   type   of   medications   prescribed.   The   current   DoD   EHR   cannot automatically provide for the mandatory notification and receipt confirmation documentation 
(between   the   MTF   competent   medical   authority   and   individual   unit   commanders   or installation operational assurance officials) of a Service Member‘s health status, operational 
capabilities/limitations, or his/her fitness for duty following each patient encounter.  Because of  this  limitation,  MTF  personnel  will  print  each  patient  encounter  form(s)  following  each 
episode of care so that all administrative notifications regarding the patient‘s operational capability/reliability   may   be   recorded   (by   hand)   on   the   same   document.      Following 
notification  documentation,  any  forms  printed  from  the  EHR  will  be  filed  into  the  Service Member‘s paper outpatient medical or dental treatment record. 
5.4.6.  The combination of the EHR and the paper record constitutes a complete health record for  a  beneficiary  and  both  record  types  need  to  be  available  for  inspection,  review,  and 
copying  when  required.    Failure  to  maintain  the  paper  medical  record  as  outlined  in  this instruction  will  result  in  a  program  deficiency  and  may  violate  the  Health  Insurance 
Portability   and   Accountability   Act   of   1996,   Air   Force   Inspection   Agency   and   Joint Commission standards. 
5.4.7.  Since  AHLTA  is  operational  at  all  active  duty  military  MTFs,  MTF  health  records personnel  are  not  required  to  print  AHLTA  patient encounter notes prior to a beneficiary‘s 
PCS  reassignment,  personal  geographic  location  move,  MTF  reassignment,  or  change  to TRICARE enrollment location.  However, if a beneficiary is moving or PCSing to a remote 
location  without  access  to  AHLTA,  then  all  historical  AHLTA  patient  encounter  notes  and all  laboratory  and  radiology  CHCS  results,  must  be  printed  and  filed  into  the  Service 
Treatment Record (STR). 5.4.7.1.  Prior  to  any  PCS  reassignment,  personal  geographic  location  move,  MTF 
reassignment,  or  change  to  TRICARE  enrollment  location,  MTF  records  personnel  will identify, print, and file into the patient‘s paper outpatient medical record, all CHCS 
laboratory,  radiology,  and/or  clinical  diagnostic  results  that  have  accumulated  from  the departure/losing MTF for each outgoing beneficiary.  The losing MTF must still transfer 
the paper record to the gaining MTF.  These procedures are required to ensure the gaining MTF has access to the beneficiary‘s complete health record.  While laboratory and 
----------------Page (210) Break----------------
  212  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
radiology  reports  are  usually  available  in  AHLTA  from  any  MTF  location,  printing  all available laboratory and radiology reports prior to a beneficiary‘s MTF transfer will 
alleviate a portion of this burden prior to final record disposition. 5.4.8.  MTF personnel  must  establish  procedures  to  provide  beneficiaries  copies  of  their 
medical  documentation  from  their  electronic  record  when  requested.    The  format  of  the documentation can be either paper or electronic; whichever is acceptable by the beneficiary.  
If  the  documentation  is  provided  in  electronic  format,  MTF  personnel  must  ensure  their facility  is  in  compliance  with  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  of 
1996 in regards to modes of transmission to the beneficiary. 5.4.9.  Documenting MTF Healthcare in AHLTA (Minimum Operational Rules). 
5.4.9.1.  It  is  a  prohibited  activity  to  enter,  upload,  or  transfer  information,  documents, files,  or  images  to  the  EHR  that  would  not  normally  be  available  to  patients,  e.g., 
documentation created or governed by Quality Assurance (QA) business rules, including peer   review   results   or   any   QA   related   information;   root   cause   analysis   or   other 
information  not  normally  considered  part  of  a  medical  record.    Information  of  this  type will not be entered or uploaded into the CDR. 
5.4.9.2.  The usefulness of aggregate data sets is only as good as the individual healthcare professional's  adherence  to  rules  designed  to  make  this  database  complete,  secure, 
searchable, accessible, and accurate. 5.4.9.3.  The   operational   processes   listed   herein   were   current   at   the   time   of   this 
publication.    Advances  in  technology  often  outpace  policy  development;  therefore  this policy  guide  attempts  to  outline rules  for  usage  of  the current  technology  and  to  clarify 
operating  parameters  when  anticipated  technological  advances  occur.    This  instruction also  includes  a  transition  timeline  projection  for  moving  to  an  electronic  environment 
where  (1)  the  paper  record  is  only  retrieved  by  exception,  (2)  the  filing  of  all  paper documents is eliminated, and, (3) when to ―retire‖ or disposition paper records.  The 
timelines includes firm policy guidance.  When certain milestones are reached, a specific set of actions must occur. 
5.4.9.4.  The   following   instructions   apply.   The   development   of   alternative   plans independent  of  HQ  AF/SG and/or  DoD  guidelines  is  not  authorized  without  permission 
from  AF/SG3.    Alternative  data  capture  and  documentation  methods  not  originally identified or engineered for permanent storage into the CDR, are not authorized without 
approval  from  AF/SG3.    Any  other  use  of  technology  contrary  to  guidance  provided  in this instruction must be discontinued until permission is granted for process continuation.  
Forward  all  waiver  requests  to the  Chief,  Health  Benefits  Branch,  Air  Force  Medical Support  Agency  (AFMSA/SG3SA).    Exceptions  must  clearly  state  why  the  facility 
cannot change to an approved methodology.  Waiver requests will be considered with a global or Service-wide standardization impact perspective. 
5.4.9.5.  Every  Air  Force  MTF  will  use  AHLTA  to  document  outpatient  patient  care.  AHLTA also supports a dental record module.  However, by the date of this publication, 
the  AHLTA  dental  module  was  not  yet  deployed  to  every  DTF.  All  outpatient  MTF entries  (except  Emergency  Department  entries)  must  be  entered  into  AHLTA.    Use  of 
structured  text  within  AHLTA  is  highly  encouraged.  As  other  automated  methods  of 
----------------Page (211) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   213  
entry  become  available,  these  processes  will  likely  be  authorized  following  analysis  by AF/SG3.  Clinical data collection and document ―template‖ use is encouraged, using 
AHLTA capabilities to leverage documentation technique. 5.4.9.6.  Printing  AHLTA  Information  and  Encounters.  Printing  and  filing  of  patient 
encounters  stored  in  AHLTA  is  not  required  in  most  cases.    Electronic  signature capability  eliminated  the  need  to  print  and  sign  documents  created  in  AHLTA.    Any 
automated clinical encounters, results, or notes that a provider feels a patient would need or benefit from, by obtaining a printed paper copy, are authorized to be printed during a 
patient visit and handed to the patient. 5.4.9.6.1.  Notable Exceptions: 
a.  Health Record Retirement or Disposition.  Until further notice or until an automated solution is identified that provides for the secure and reliable transfer or disposition of stored AHLTA 
medical information from the MTF to either the National Personnel Records Center or to the Department of Veteran Affairs, MTF records personnel (including dental clinic staff) are 
required to print all of the electronic AHLTA information (e.g., patient encounter notes, Clinical Notes section entries, telephone consultations, referral management/consultation results, etc.) 
and file into the patient‘s paper dental and/or outpatient medical record before physically mailing the record(s) to the appropriate disposition center. 
b.  Health Records for Service Members Assigned to Sensitive Duties.  See paragraph 5.4.5. c.  Reserve Component Health Records.  Many RCMUs still do not have access to CHCS or 
AHLTA.  For this reason, following each completely closed and properly coded patient encounter, the patient encounter note should be printed, filed, or forwarded to the MTF or 
medical unit normally responsible for maintaining the RCSM‘s health records.  If a local written agreement is in place which delineates health record documentation and transfer requirements 
and expectations, the local agreement may be used (if current and documented in the MTF) as a suitable exception to this rule. 
5.4.9.7.  Electronic/Digital   File   Types   and   Files   Size.      Use   ONLY   the   following electronic file types when capturing documents, files, or images into an AHLTA patient 
encounter note: TXT, RTF, HTML, TIF, JPG, BMP, and DOC.  Note:  PDF files cannot be directly uploaded into AHLTA; however, the information contained within a .PDF file 
may be copied and pasted into the ―Add Note‖ using the Adobe Reader Snapshot tool.  Imported documents, files, or images will not exceed 500kb. 
5.4.9.8.  Placement  of  Scanned/Uploaded/Imported  Documents,  Files,  and  Images  into AHLTA. 
5.4.9.8.1.  Within a Patient Encounter Note: A scanned document, file, or image may be  uploaded  or  imbedded  into  an  AHLTA  patient  encounter  note,  provided  the 
document or image is a) is directly related to the current patient encounter, b) will not delay the coding of the patient encounter note, and c) can be uploaded into the patient 
encounter note before the provider electronically signs the encounter.  By signing the encounter,   the   provider   is   acknowledging   that   the   scanned/uploaded   image   or 
document was acceptable for its intended purpose. 5.4.9.8.1.1.  Appending  a  patient  encounter  note  after  the  note  is  Closed/Signed.

If   the   document   cannot   be   imbedded   into   the   note   before   the   provider electronically  signs,  or  if  an  image  is  captured,  or  scanned  and  uploaded  in 
support  of  a  previous   episode  of  care,  the  document  or  image  should  be "appended"   to   the   desired   note.      This   action   will   generate   an   automatic 
notification  to  the  provider/user  that  created  the  original  encounter  note.    The notification   mechanism   lets   the   original   creator   know   that   someone   has 
―appended‖ his or her original patient encounter note.  Appending a previously closed  encounter with  an  uploaded  image  will  not  change  the original  encounter 
information.  Appended patient encounter notes must also be electronically signed by  the  user  adding  the  additional  image  or  document.    Appending  a  note  is  a 
permanent  action  and  cannot  be  reversed.    Appended  documentation  is  not searchable.    Without  prior  knowledge  that  a  specific  encounter  note  has  been 
appended with an image, subsequent users may have significant difficulty finding the appended image or they may not even know of its existence. 
5.4.9.8.2.  Within Clinical Notes or as a ―Stand-Alone‖ Document.  The practice of creating,  importing,  or  uploading  scanned  documents  and  images  into  AHLTA  (not 
directly imbedded within a patient encounter note), is not authorized without approval from  AFMSA/SG3SA.    In  the  future,  managing  the  capability  to  create,  import,  or 
upload, stand-alone scanned documents should be accomplished through the HAIMS application. 
5.4.9.8.3.  Alternative Methods to Capture Consults and Referral Results.  AHLTA is not  to  be  used  for  volume  storage  of  TRICARE  network  consultation  report  or 
referral  results  storage  without  approval  from  AFMSA/SG3SA.  An optional  method that  allows  temporary  data  collection,  storage,  authorized  user  viewing,  and  data 
sharing of electronic copies of consultation reports and referral results received from civilian medical providers, is identified below. 
a.  MTFs are authorized to use a local, secure, shared computer server or data storage device, to temporarily store consultation reports and referral results received from civilian medical 
providers and specialists. b.  Electronic copies of consultation reports or referral results received, scanned, and imported 
into AHLTA, from external MTF providers (for which no authorized waiver has been approved by AFMSA/SG3SA that allows importing and/or uploading of reports or results into AHLTA) 
must be destroyed no later than 30 days following electronic file copy creation date (e.g., the date the document is imported into AHLTA). 
c.  There is no limitation (unless prescribed locally) to specific file size or type (in the MTF shared computer server). 
d.  The MTF is required to create specific processes and business rules to a) ensure the referring provider has access to the temporary electronically stored consultation report or referral results 
and is aware that said electronic document(s), file(s), or image(s), will only be available for viewing 30 days following the creation of the electronic copy, and b) processes are in place to 
ensure the original consultation report or referral result(s) are filed in the patient‘s paper outpatient medical record. 
e.  The official government e-mail transfer of consultation reports and referral results aka PHI is 
----------------Page (213) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   215  
authorized as long as the message(s) is digitally signed and encrypted.  Access to shared MTF computer folders and files, containing PHI, must be limited to users who can demonstrate a 
verifiable need for access.  Shared computer folders and files must offer limited user access and password protection.  Once a Data at Rest solution is deployed, PHI on shared drives must be 
encrypted in accordance with security standards. 5.4.9.9.  Filing   Documents   into   the   Paper   Health   Record   Following   Scanning   and 
Uploading into AHLTA.  Until potential future document filing policies allow, any paper document, normally required to be filed into either the paper outpatient medical or dental 
treatment record, which has been scanned and the electronic copy uploaded into AHLTA (not  including  documents  created  in  AHLTA),  must  also  be  filed  into  the  outpatient 
medical  or  dental  treatment  record  according  to  standard  filing  requirements.    If  a particular  type  of  paper  document  is  regularly  reviewed  and  signed  (by  hand)  by  a 
provider,  before  filing into  the  outpatient  medical  or  dental  treatment  record,  the  same document  must  still  be  signed  (by  hand)  no  matter  if  the  document  was  scanned  and 
uploaded   into   AHLTA.      EXCEPTION:      Hard   copy   civilian   provider   referral   or consultation  results  received  by  the  Referral  Management  Center  and  captured  into 
AHLTA  (and  electronically  signed  by  the  referring  provider  or  surrogate)  are  not required to be hand signed or ―wet‖ signed by the referring provider.  These same 
documents are not required to be filed into the patient‘s outpatient medical record. 5.4.9.10.  Scanning   Entire   Paper   Health   Records   for   Importing   or   Uploading   into 
AHLTA or other Secure Database. 5.4.9.10.1.  The   practice   of   scanning   entire   original   paper   health   records   for 
permanent storage, importing, or uploading into AHLTA or other secure  database is prohibited.    Mass  or  multiple  record  scanning  initiatives  intended  to  electronically 
copy  entire  health  records,  for  any  reason  other  than  preservation  of  weather  or  fire damaged paper records, or Release of Information programs (copies for beneficiaries) 
are prohibited.  This practice has been analyzed and deemed too costly and provides no significant value to providers during their day-to-day operations. 
5.4.9.11.  Scanning  in  Lieu  of  Paper  Copies.    The  practice  of  scanning  original  health records in lieu of copying (for MTFs that offer this option) is authorized, as long as: 
5.4.9.11.1.  Digital  or  electronic  memory  compact  or  read-writable  discs  or  storage media are marked with the following statement, ―This electronic storage media may 
contain  information  covered  under  the  Privacy  Act,  5  U.S.C.  §  552(a),  and/or  the Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (PL  104-191)  and  its  various 
implementing   regulations   and   must   be   protected   in   accordance   with   those provisions.‖ 
5.4.9.11.2.  Scanned  documents,  files,  and  images   are  not  stored  on  any  local computer,  MTF  computer  hard  drive  or  shared  network  drive  or  folder.    Scanned 
images  and  documents  must  be deleted  from  all  computer,  copier,  and  scanner  hard drives, or the computer drives or memory devices within these machines are secured 
from unauthorized access at all times. 5.4.9.11.3.  Digital  or  electronic  memory  compact  or  read-writable  discs  or  storage 
media  are  not  accidentally  or  purposefully  included  with  paper  health  records  and 
----------------Page (214) Break----------------
  216  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
forwarded  to  the  National  Personnel  Records  Center  (NPRC)  or  to  the  Veteran Affairs   Records   Management   Center   via   approved   Air   Force   health   records 
disposition intermediary. 5.4.9.12.  Electronic signatures on forms and documents.  Handwritten (―wet‖) signatures 
and  initials  are  not  required  on  printouts  of  electronic  forms  and  documents  created  by the  following  systems:    CHCS,  AHLTA,  AHLTA-T,  Essentris,  and TRICARE  Online.  
Electronic  signatures  and  initials  in  these  systems  are  equivalent  to  full  handwritten signatures and initials. 
5.4.9.13.  Retrieving Outpatient Medical Records by Exception:  The MTF Commander, with the recommendations from the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff (ECOMS) 
and  Health  Records  Committee,  may  approve  a  "retrieve  or  pull  records  by  exception" rule for paper outpatient medical records and suspend or discontinue the routine delivery 
of  paper medical  records  to  some  or all  providers  in  the requested  work  center(s).    The decision  to  stop  or  suspend  the  practice  of  retrieving  or  pulling  outpatient  medical  or 
dental  treatment  records  must  be  carefully  considered.    Only  after  addressing  the following minimum questions should a requesting work center, clinic, specialty group, or 
FHE team submit a request to the ECOMS function. 5.4.9.13.1.  Have  procedures  been  developed  to  validate  the  beneficiary‘s 
acknowledgement of the MHS Notice of Privacy Practices?  Refer to paragraph 6.5. for additional information and requirements. 
5.4.9.13.2.  How  will  the requesting  clinic identify  patients  with  chronic conditions?  Some  providers  prefer  to  quickly  review  the  outpatient  medical  record  or  dental 
treatment record of patient with a chronic condition. 5.4.9.13.3.  If a provider needs a paper record on a specific patient during treatment, 
how will the clinic ensure the patient‘s health record can be quickly obtained and delivered to the requesting provider? 
5.4.9.13.4.  How will the transition from the traditional health record ―pull all‖ to ―pull by exception‖ MTF business rule affect the requesting work center‘s record 
availability rate? 5.4.9.13.5.  With recommendation from the Health Records Management Committee, 
medical  record  retrieval  variations  may  exist  within  an  MTF  that  require  specific clinics to retrieve/receive the paper outpatient or dental treatment record in addition to 
accessing AHLTA.  This requirement should be reviewed annually (at a minimum) in order  to  ensure  that  resources  required  to  manage  records  are  used  to  the  best 
advantage of overall operations. 5.4.9.14.  "Historic Scanning by Exception."  If a provider identifies a document, file, or 
image  (significant  or absolutely  critical  to  support  patient  care)  from  any  portion  of  the patient's paper outpatient medical or dental treatment record and if said document, file, or 
image is to be scanned and uploaded into AHLTA for regular future reference, then the document,  file, or  image  may  be  scanned  and  uploaded  into  the  EHR.    Following 
scanning,  the  original  source  document,  file,  or  image  must  be  re-filed  into  the  paper health record.  The provider should then determine whether the historic data is specific to 
the episode of care, and if so then imbed or upload to the current patient encounter note 
----------------Page (215) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   217  
without delaying the coding process, or if the document, file, or image should be scanned and uploaded into the AHLTA Clinical Notes section as an independent, ―stand-alone‖ 
document.  However, the practice of capturing electronic documents, files, and images in the AHLTA Clinical Notes section is only authorized when, 1) the capability to ―lock-in‖ 
an absolutely critical uploaded document or image via an electronic signature mechanism is available, and 2) only after approval from AFMSA/SG3SA has been granted. 
5.4.10.  Healthcare  Artifact  and  Image  Management  Solution  (HAIMS).    HAIMS  is  a Military  Health  System  (MHS)  strategic  project  that  will  enhance  medical  informatics 
through  seamless  integration  of  medical  digital  images  into  the  EHR.  The  objective  of HAIMS  is  to  give  healthcare  providers  global  awareness  and  access  to  essential  healthcare 
artifacts and images (A&I) throughout the continuum of care from Theater to the Sustaining Base  to  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).    The  HAIMS  will  provide  a  single 
enterprise-wide  image  sharing  capability  for  all  types  of  A&I,  including  radiographs, photographs, wave forms, audio files, video files and scanned documents. 
5.5.  Electronically-Generated Forms (EF). 5.5.1.  Use  only  the  AF-approved  forms  package.    Word  processing  packages  are  directly 
forbidden because there is no method of locking the form so that it cannot be changed by the user, see AFI 33-360 Publications and Forms Management.  Most Air Force (AF), Standard 
(SF) and Optional  Forms (OP) can be obtained from the Air Force  e-Publishing website at: http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.      Additionally,   DoD   Forms   may   be   retrieved   at   the 
Department                                    of                                    Defense                                    site: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/formsprogram.htm.     Both     websites 
have links to Standard, Optional, DoD, and other federal agency electronic forms. 5.5.2.  The  only  exception  to  the  policy  in  5.5.1.  is  forms  for  which  AFMOA/SGAT  has 
identified standard data elements. 5.5.3.  For  these  forms,  the  standard  elements  are  required  but  mirror  imaging  of  the  paper 
form is no longer required.  Additional data elements that would change the meaning of the form cannot be added.  Standard patient information is required on these forms. 
5.5.3.1.  Patient  information  blocks  on  outpatient  forms  will include  the  following elements.  Under Patient  Information, include Name (last, first, middle), Sponsors SSN, 
Patient  FMP,  Sex,  Date  of  Birth,  Rank/Grade,  Department/Service  Where  Records Maintained,  and  Relationship  to  Sponsor.    Under  Sponsor  Information, include  Name 
(last, first, middle) and SSN/Identification Number.  Under Facility Information, include Name of MTF. 
5.5.3.2.  Patient   information   blocks   on   inpatient   forms   will   include   the   following elements.      Under   Patient   Information,   include   Name   (last,   first,   middle),   Patient 
FMP/Sponsors   SSN,   Sex,   Date   of   Birth,   Rank/Grade,   Department/Service   Where Records  Maintained,  Relationship  to  Sponsor,  Register  Number,  and  Ward  Number.  
Under  Sponsor  Information,  include  Name  (last,  first,  middle)  and  SSN/Identification Number.  Under Facility Information, include Name of MTF. 
5.5.4.  To date, the forms for which standard data elements have been identified for the body of the form are:  SF 93, SF 505, SF 506, SF 509, SF 526, SF 551, SF 558, SF 559,  SF 600, 
----------------Page (216) Break----------------
  218  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
and OF 523B.  Contact AFMOA/SGAT for a list of the identified standard data elements for these and any subsequent forms for which standard data elements have been identified. 
5.5.5.  Optional  Form  (OF)  275,  Medical  Record  Report,  may  be used  in  lieu  of  Standard forms, Air Force forms and DoD forms.  OF 275, if used, must indicate the form number and 
title  of  the  form  being  replaced.    Information  entered  on  the  form  must  include  all  of  the same information as the form it represents.  File the OF 275 in the same location as the form 
it replaces.  This form is not to be used for the creation of local forms. 5.5.6.  If an MTF desires to create a local form in lieu of a form that already exists, a waiver 
must be requested from AFMOA/SGAT. 5.5.7.  In  an  effort  to  reduce  the  unnecessary  use  of  SSNs,  DoD  has  begun  the  use  of 
alternative  Personal  Identifiers  in  place  of  the  SSN.    The  alternative  Personal  Identifiers include  the  DoD  Identification  (ID)  Number  which  uniquely  identifies  individuals  and  the 
DoD  Benefits  Number  that  identifies  individuals  eligible  to  receive  DoD  benefits  such  as commissary,  exchange,  and  TRICARE  benefits.  According  to  the  MHS  Interim  SSN 
Reduction  Plan, 17  Oct  2011,  the Military  Health  System,  when  feasible,  will  limit  the use and  display  of  SSNs  while  migrating  systems  and  business  processes  to  use  the  DoD  ID 
Number. 5.5.7.1.  Local  MTF  forms  must  be  reviewed  for  the  necessity  of  SSN  use.    MTFs  are 
encouraged to use DoD ID Numbers in place of SSNs on local forms.  To locate SSNs, MTFs may obtain the SSN from General Inquiry of DEERS (GIQD) Web Application by 
cross matching the DoD ID Number on the ID card or form with the DoD ID Number in the  system.    If  the  MTF  determines  the  continued  use  of  the SSN  on  a  local  form  is 
necessary,  the  MTF  must  comply  with  the  justification  procedures  set  forth  in  AFI  33-332, Air Force Privacy Program. 
5.6.  Overprinting of Forms.  Overprints do not change the information collected on a form and are authorized IAW DoD 7750.07-M, DoD Forms Management Program Procedures Manual and 
AFI  33-360.    The  specific overprint  must  be  a)  approved  by  the  local  body  responsible for the medical record review function, b) recorded in the minutes of that body, and c) approved by the 
MTF Commander.    Follow instructions in AFI 33-360 concerning inclusion of the name of your organization followed by ―overprint‖ in the lower right margin of the form; for example, 579 
MDG Overprint.  This waiver concerns overprinting only and does not grant authority to reprint existing Standard Forms at the local level.  The list of Air Force forms authorized for overprint 
follows: 5.6.1.  AF Form 230, Request for Patient Transfer. 
5.6.2.  AF Form 250, Health Record Charge Out Request. 5.6.3.  AF Form 560, Authorization and Treatment Statement. 
5.6.4.  AF Form 565, Record of Inpatient Treatment. 5.6.5.  AF Form 569, Patient‘s Absence Record. 
5.6.6.  AF Form 570, Notification of Patient‘s Medical Status. 5.6.7.  AF Form 577, Patient‘s Clearance Record. 
5.6.8.  AF Form 2700L, Health Record Year Grid. 
----------------Page (217) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   219  
5.6.9.  AF Form 745, Sensitive Duties Program Record Identifier. 5.6.10.  AF Form 1403, Roster of Seriously Ill/Very Seriously Ill. 
5.6.11.  AF Form 1942, Clinic Index. 5.6.12.  AF Form 1976, Hematology. 
5.6.13.  AF Form 3066, Doctor‘s Orders (multiple copy format). 5.6.14.  AF Form 3066-1, Doctor‘s Orders (cut sheet format). 
5.7.  Medical   and   Dental   Treatment   Record   Disposition/Retirement   Procedures.  The following sections contains guidance regarding the proper disposition, also known at transfer or 
retirement of outpatient medical and dental records to the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) via  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC),  Central  Records  Disposition  Center,  National 
Personnel Records Center (NPRC), Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) or to a RCMU. 5.7.1.  Service  Treatment  Records  (STR)  Disposition  Process  for  Retiring,  Separating,  and 
Transitioning  Airmen  from  the  Active  to  the  Reserve  Component.    Until  necessary  data communication  links  are  permanently  established  between  both  the  military  and  DVA 
electronic health record systems, MTF records personnel will print and file (into the patient‘s paper record) any and all available ancillary, diagnostic or clinical information electronically 
stored in standardized Military Health System or local MTF electronic health record systems prior to final records retirement processing and shipment.  This rule applies to both military 
and family member health records. 5.7.1.1.  The  transition  from  paper-based  health  treatment  records  to  electronic  health 
records  is  progressing  satisfactorily.    However,  as  caretakers  of  the  paper  medical  and dental records we still use, we must do all we can to guarantee this health information is 
properly maintained, tracked, stored, and transferred or ―dispositioned.‖ 5.7.1.2.  Historically,  MTF  and  Reserve  Component  (Air  National Guard  and  Air  Force 
Reserve)  medical  unit  health  records  managers  routinely  forwarded   the  STR  (the combination   of   outpatient   medical   and   dental   treatment   records)   for   retiring   and 
separating Airmen to the local installation MPS prior to an Airman‘s final out-processing appointment.      Following   the   MPS   retirement   and/or   separation   out-processing 
appointment,  MPS  officials  packaged  and  shipped  the  records  to  the  Department  of Veterans Affairs (DVA) Records Management Center (RMC) in St. Louis, MO, or to the 
regional DVA office responsible for processing the Airman‘s disability evaluation claim.  Unfortunately,  this  process  produced  a  number  of  process  problems  for  DVA  and  the 
Principal  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Personnel  and  Readiness  (PDUSD (P&R)) directed  the  Services  to  institute  management  systems  to  ensure  timely  and 
accurate disposition of STRs to the DVA. 5.7.1.3.  In late 2008, officials from the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and the Air 
Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA) created a new STR disposition process.  This new  process  mandated  that  all  Active  Duty  (AD)   Air  Force  MTFs  and  Reserve 
Component  (RC)  medical  units  begin  mailing  STRs  for  retiring  and  separating  Airmen (with a separation or retirement date effective 1 Jan 09 and thereafter) to the new AFPC 
Records Disposition Center at Randolph AFB, TX, instead of forwarding records to the installation MPS or individual unit Commander‘s Support Staff (CSS) offices.  This new 
----------------Page (218) Break----------------
  220  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
centralized  mailing  requirement  streamlines  the  STR  disposition  process  by  improving the  accuracy  and  speed  in  which  STRs  are  provided  to  the  DVA  as  well  as  prevent 
misplaced records. 5.7.1.4.  Total  Force  Applicability:    This  STR  disposition  policy  applies  equally  to  the 
Active Duty (AD) and RC.  Although the following language specifically mentions MTF responsibilities and expectations, the guidance also applies to Air Force Reserve (AFR), 
Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  medical  units,  and  organizations  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  maintenance  and  storage of  Reserve  Component  STRs.    The  AFPC  Records 
Disposition  Center  at  Randolph  AFB,  TX is  the  only  Air  Force  records  disposition  unit authorized  to  forward  AD  and  RC  STRs  to  the  DVA.    MTFs  and  RCMUs  are  not 
authorized to mail records directly to the DVA. 5.7.1.5.  All  MTF  and  DTF  records  management  personnel  are  expected  to  apply  the 
following   directions   to   their   STR   disposition   plan.      MTF   records   managers   and supervisors are encouraged to work closely with their DTF counterparts and local MPS, 
Military  Personnel  Element  (MPE),  Military  Personnel  Squadron  (MPS),  or  Force Support Squadron (FSS) officials to make this transition as smooth as possible. 
5.7.1.6.  Incorporate  the  following  STR  disposition  instructions  into  all  standard  MTF, DTF,   and RCMU   service   treatment   records   disposition   instructions   for   retiring, 
separating, discharging, and transitioning members. 5.7.1.7.  AFPC Retirement/Separation Notification Roster (aka LOSS Roster). 
5.7.1.7.1.  In   order   to   streamline   the   process   and   standardize   LOSS   Rosters acquisition  procedures,  an  Air  Force  Knowledge  Now - USAF/SG  Community  of 
Practice (CoP) website was created so MTF, DTF, and RCMU records managers and installation  personnelists  could  easily  obtain  this  time  sensitive  information.    The 
retirements/separations  LOSS  rosters  were  simultaneously  posted  to  the  SG  and Personnel CoPs. 
5.7.1.7.2.  Personnel  LOSS  rosters  include  a  listing  of  all  projected  retiring  and separating   AD   and   retiring   and   discharging   RCSMs   (including   geographically 
separated unit (GSU) personnel).  The  Loss Roster was further refined in June 2009 to  include  Airmen  scheduled  for  separation  and  retirement  during  the  applicable 
retirement/separation  action  month.    Additionally,  the  roster  was  updated to  reflect those  Airmen  who  retired  or  separated  during  a  previous  month  and  AFPC  has  not 
received a complete STR.  The ―Q‖ column on the LOSS roster indicates records which have still not been received by AFPC.  These records will remain on the roster 
until AFPC receives the records. 5.7.1.7.3.  Identified MTF, DTF, and RCMU personnel must obtain the LOSS roster 
from  the  AF/SG  CoP  each  month.    The  local  MPS,  which  has  access  to  the  Loss Rosters via the AFPC Field Operations CoP, will continue to provide support in the 
case of short-notice changes and any other questions which might arise.  These LOSS rosters  contain  protected  personnel  information  and  the  CoP  will  contain  all  rosters 
for  all  facilities.    Therefore,  access  to  the  page  will  be  restricted  to  only  those individuals who require access to perform STR disposition duties. 
----------------Page (219) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   221  
5.7.1.7.4.  Each MTF or RCMU is authorized one primary and four alternate points of contact  (POCs).    (Recommendation – include  the  dental  records  manager  and  the 
TOPA or Patient Administration element chief or flight commander as alternates.)  A sample  (template)  is  available  on  the  AF/SG  CoP  and  the  AFMOA  Health  Benefits 
KX page.  The roster is in Excel format and can be downloaded, saved and distributed locally as the MTF, DTF, or RCMU deem necessary.  However, given the Personally 
Identifiable Information (PII) included on the spreadsheet, access must be limited to only  those  with  a  need  to  know.    E-mail  messages  containing  PII  must  be  digitally 
signed and encrypted. 5.7.1.7.5.  At  MTFs  with  decentralized  medical  record  filing  rooms,  the  TRICARE 
Operations  and  Patient  Administration  office  are  responsible  for  distributing  the LOSS rosters to each record room. 
5.7.1.7.6.  Use  the  following  guidance  to  select  and  identify  the  responsible  MTF, DTF, and RCMU personnel: 
a.  POCs must be appointed in writing. b.  The appointment letter must include the reason for request and must be signed by the 
squadron commander. c.  Address appointment letters to AFMOA/SGAT and either fax or e-mail the document.  
Contact AFMOA/SGAT for the latest fax telephone number.  E-mail requests to: afmoa.sgat@us.af.mil. 
d.  Once the appointment letter is submitted and approved, the POCs must request access to the Medical Record Management section of the SG CoP at 
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-SG-AF-90. 5.7.1.7.7.  The LOSS rosters are located in the main folder "Medical Record Rosters,‖ 
and then in the sub-folder for the applicable month.  The folders correspond with the month the roster was run.  For example, the September 2010 roster is located in the 
"Sep 10"  folder which reflects the September 2010 losses, even though the majority are not ―actionable‖ until October (30-35 calendar days post- DOS). 
5.7.1.7.8.  Each  roster  in  the  CoP  is  listed  separately  by  base.    A  few  bases  have Guard or Reserve units assigned in addition to the AD MTF. These bases will appear 
to  be  listed  more  than  once.    The  first  2  digits  of  the  PAS  Code  determine  the applicability  of  the  roster.    Generally,  AD  PAS  codes  are  two  ALPHA  characters.  
For   instance,   McConnell   AFB   could   appear   three   times:         McConnell   (D6); McConnell (MK); and  McConnell (R2).  The  MTF roster is identified  by (MK), the 
Guard roster is identified by (D6) and the Reserve unit is identified by (R2). 5.7.1.7.9.  Some of the larger facilities have more than one MPS providing services at 
their  base.    Military  MTFs  and  RCMUs  will  also  need  to  know  the  two-digit  PAS Code for each of those MPS/GSUs for which they provide care/maintain records. 
5.7.1.7.9.1.  PAS  Codes  can  be  obtained  from  the  AFPC  secure  web  site  at:  https://w20.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFPCSecureNet20/PKI/MainMenu1.aspx.  
After accessing the site, click ―OK,‖ then ―PASS CODES.‖  The PAS codes are also located on the AF/SG CoP in the Departure Rosters folder.

  222  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.7.1.7.10.  For  questions  regarding  which  roster  to  obtain,  contact  your  local  Force Support  Squadron,  or  your  AFMOA  Health  Benefits  regional  representative  for 
assistance. 5.7.1.7.11.  Facilities have a window of opportunity when records should be mailed to 
AFPC.  The  LOSS  roster  contains  two  columns  for  shipment dates, ―Not Earlier Than‖ and ―Not Later Than.‖  The ―Not Earlier Than‖ date is 30 days after the 
member‘s date of retirement/separation (DOS) and the ―Not Later Than‖ date is 35 days after the member‘s date of retirement or separation.  Medical records personnel 
at all Air Force MTFs and RCMUs must mail a retiring/separating member‘s STR to AFPC no earlier than 30 days past the DOS and no later than 35 days past the DOS. 
5.7.1.7.12.  Geographically   Separated   Units   (GSUs):      When   the   GSU   member separates/retires; his name will appear on the LOSS roster of the MTF serviced by the 
MPS  to  which  the  member  is  assigned.    However,  STRs  for  retiring  and  separating Air   Force   service   members   assigned   to   remote   units   or   GSUs   are   frequently 
maintained at the installation MTF located nearest to the GSU site.  If the Airman is enrolled to a TRICARE network Primary Care Manager (PCM), his civilian medical 
documents are maintained at the network PCM office. 5.7.1.7.13.  OCONUS   Based   Member   Retiring/Separating:      Based   on   AFPC 
guidance,     retiring/separating     members     assigned     OCONUS     are     directly retired/separated by the OCONUS MPS; members are no longer PCS‘d to CONUS 
for retirement/separation processing.  However, even if a retiring/separating member based    at    an    OCONUS    MTF    returns    stateside    just    for    the    purpose    of 
retiring/separating,  the  OCONUS  MTF  STR  Loss  roster  will  normally  reflect  the member as retiring/separating and it is the OCONUS MTF‘s responsibility to ensure 
the STR is appropriately processed to AFPC. 5.7.1.7.14.  Air Force Reserve Rosters:  Each month, AF Reserve MPSs provide the 
servicing Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) a listing  of all assigned Airmen serviced by the installation MPS, including geographically separated unit (GSU) personnel with a 
60-day  projected  retirement,  discharge,  or  transition  to  inactive  status  date.    The RMU  has  the  option  of  using  the  Reserve  MPS  list  or  downloading  the  AFPC 
retirement/discharge  roster (LOSS  Roster)  from  the AF/SG CoP.   Note:  the rosters used to compute metrics reside on the AF/SG CoP.  It is highly recommended that RC 
staff pull the roster from the CoP to ensure all records are sent. 5.7.1.7.15.  Air  National  Guard  Rosters:    Guard  medical  units  will  download  the 
AFPC retirement/discharge roster (LOSS Roster) from the AF/SG CoP. 5.7.1.8.  Retirement/Separation/Transition Orders. 
5.7.1.8.1.  Active Duty Personnel. 5.7.1.8.1.1.  Member Responsibilities. 
a.  Retiring/Separating Airmen are required to report to the central MTF health records customer service location and the installation DTF with their retirement orders no later than five days prior 
to the member‘s final out-processing appointment.  The member is required to provide four copies of their retirement orders (or, in the case of separations, the AF Form 100, Request and 
----------------Page (221) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   223  
Authorization for Separation); two for the MTF and two for the DTF records departments. b.  Airmen transitioning from the AD to the RC are required to report to the central MTF health 
records customer service location with their service transition order, PCS order, or Active Duty separation order no later than five days prior to the member‘s final out-processing appointment.  
The member is required to provide two copies of the service transition order, PCS order, or Active Duty separation order. (Specific rules regarding the disposition or the transfer of STRs for 
Airmen transitioning from the Active to the Reserve or Guard Component are identified later in this same section). 
5.7.1.8.1.2.  MTF/DTF Responsibilities: a.  The MTF and DTF will each place one copy of the orders in the member‘s outpatient medical 
and dental treatment records. (Placement Location 1) Outpatient medical record - Section II on top of all other pages; (Placement Location 2) Dental treatment record - Inside right-side folder 
section. b.  The second copy of the orders will be placed into a plastic AF Form 885-887 series, Medical 
Record Charge-Out Guide and filed in place of the record.  It is also recommended to include a reference to where the record is located (transitory file) until the record is mailed. 
c.  Missing Orders:  If, after contacting the MPS or accessing the Virtual MPS, a copy of the orders cannot be obtained, draft a memorandum (on squadron letter head stationary) and indicate 
this inability to obtain the orders and place in the Airman‘s outpatient medical and dental records.  Include in the memorandum the name and number of the MPS POC who was contacted.  
Verifying or checking with the MPS is required to ensure the Service Member did not re-enlist or extend his or her enlistment.  The applicable squadron commander or flight commander 
responsible for the operational day-to-day maintenance and storage of said records must sign the memorandum.  (The signature block must reflect the job title of the person signing).  See 
Attachment 14 for a sample missing order memorandum template.  The example template is also available on the AF/SG CoP. 
d.  Active Duty Virtual MPS Checklist Confirmation.    Historically, only the MTF Force Health Management (FHM) staff had access to the Virtual MPS.  In May 2010, AFPC directed all MPSs 
to authorize MTF and DTF Records Rooms access.  MTF health records offices have been added as mandatory out-processing checklist destinations for each outbound Service Member.  
Although the FHM may have additional medical out-processing checklist approval authority or obligations, they should not ―sign off‖ or approve any outpatient medical or dental treatment 
record out-processing tasks on a Service Member‘s Virtual MPS out-processing checklist.  Outpatient medical and dental records managers and FHM officials will work together to ensure 
each outbound Airmen has fulfilled all of his or her MTF out-processing responsibilities. e.  Checklist Operation: Multiple (at least two) staff members assigned to MTF and DTF records 
departments be granted Virtual MPS Checklist access to ensure each departing Service Member is informed of the requirement to provide the MTF and DTF with copies of his/her orders at the 
time of MTF/DTF out-processing.  Access will also allow MTF records managers to obtain and print individual retirement/separation orders when necessary.  Once added to the process or 
granted access to the Virtual MPS system, records managers can forecast the timeframe when separating and/or retiring Airmen will visit the MTF and DTF to out-process.  MTF and DTF 
records managers may also be able to add special notes to the Virtual out-processing checklists 
----------------Page (222) Break----------------
  224  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
to inform out-processing Airmen to obtain a copy of their STR no earlier than 179 calendar days and no later than 30 days prior to the date of their final separation or retirement date. 
5.7.1.8.2.  Air Force Reserve Personnel. Each month, the servicing Reserve MPS will provide the servicing RMU a copy of the retirement/discharge/transition orders or AF 
Form  1288,  Request  for  Ready  Reserve  for  all  assigned  Airmen  serviced  by  the installation MPS, including geographically separated unit (GSU) personnel with a 60-
day projected retirement, discharge, or transition to inactive status date. 5.7.1.8.3.  Air     National     Guard     Personnel.     Guard     members     receive     their 
retirement/discharge orders from the Retirements/Separations department of the MPS located at their ANG Wing.  These retirement/separation orders should be received at 
the monthly UTA (Unit Training Assembly) immediately preceding the final service obligation date. 
5.7.1.9.  The VA Claim. 5.7.1.9.1.  During the Airman‘s out-processing  visit  to  the MTF  records  department, 
records managers are required to ascertain whether or not the Airman plans to file a disability claim with the DVA. 
5.7.1.9.2.  If  the  member  has  already  completed  the  online  DVA  claim  application (VA Form 21-526), place this form in the member‘s outpatient medical record. 
5.7.1.9.3.  If  the  member  indicates  he  intends  to  file  a  claim,  and  if  the  state  DVA regional disability claims office is known, annotate the office location and address on 
the   Memorandum   for   Retiring/separating   Members   Intent   to   File   DVA   Claim (Attachment  28).   Note: this  form  is  not  mandatory/not  used  when  determining 
records disposition completion metrics.  This form is helpful when the record gets to AFPC  for  forwarding  purposes.    If  the  member  doesn‘t  intend  to  file  a  claim 
immediately, completion of the form is not necessary. 5.7.1.10.  Making Copies of Outpatient Medical and Dental Records. 
5.7.1.10.1.  For the Active Duty Service Member: 5.7.1.10.1.1.  Separating  and  retiring  Airmen  may  request  one  complete  copy  of 
their  STR  no  earlier  than  179  calendar  days  and  no  later  than  30  calendar  days prior  to  the  date  of  their  final  out-processing  appointment.    Only  one  copy  is 
authorized.  The goal is to have one complete STR copy ready for the separating or retiring Airman by the time of his final MTF/DTF out-processing appointment.  
The copy can be provided as a hard-copy record or in electronic or digital media format,  whichever  the  member  requests.   Note:  This  copy  is  for  the  member‘s 
personal  use,  not  for  the  VA  as  they  require  the  record  in  hard-copy  format.  Ensure  patient  understands  they  are  only  authorized  one  complete  copy  free  of 
charge.  They will not receive another copy (free of charge) if they give their copy to the VA. 
5.7.1.10.1.2.  Copy  requests  should  be  fulfilled  no  later  than  30  calendar  days from the date of copy request receipt.  Thirty days is a reasonable period of time 
to  complete  the  copy  request.    Copy  requests  submitted  within  30  days  of  the Service Member‘s separation or discharge out-processing appointment will likely 
----------------Page (223) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   225  
burden the office responsible for providing the copy.  Records managers must use all  available  resources  within  their  means  to  ensure  separating  and  retiring 
Airmen understand the importance of submitting their STR copy requests as early as  possible.    The  volume  of  electronic  patient  encounter  documents  generated 
from  MTF  or  DTF  visits  that  fall  within  the  30-day  cut-off  copy  request  date through  the  Airman‘s  MTF/DTF  out-processing   date   are   usually   not   that 
significant.  These few documents should be reasonably easy to identify and print from AHLTA or CHCS ―on the spot‖ or copy from the paper outpatient medical 
or dental records and added to the copy package or provided to the member at the time of out-processing. 
5.7.1.10.1.3.  MTF   records   manager   are   expected   to   notify   the   Transition Assistance Program (TAP) of the member‘s right to one copy of their record upon 
separation  or  retirement.    MTF  records  personnel  will  ensure  local  installation TAP  officials  are  aware  each  AD  Airman  enrolled  in  TAP  class  may  receive  a 
copy of their STR no earlier than 179 calendar days, but not later than 30 calendar days prior to their final retirement or separation date.  Patients requesting  copies 
after their STR has already been mailed can request them from the VA directly by calling the VA Customer Service Center (1-800-827-1000). 
5.7.1.10.2.  For the Reserve Component Service Member: 5.7.1.10.2.1.  Separating and discharging RCSMs may request one complete copy 
of their STR no earlier than 179 calendar days and no later than 90 calendar days prior  to  the  date  of  their  final  out-processing  appointment.    Only  one  copy  is 
authorized.  The goal is to have one complete STR copy ready for the retiring or discharging Airman by the completion of his/her final medical unit out-processing 
appointment. 5.7.1.10.2.2.  Requests  for  copies  should  be  fulfilled  no  later  than  90  calendar 
days  from  the  date  of  the  copy  request  receipt.    Typically,  RCMUs  are  not regularly  staffed  as  well  as  full-time  AD  MTFs.    Consequently,  opportunities  to 
make  copies  for  retiring  or  discharging  members  may  be  diminished,  sometimes limited  to  only  drill  weekends.    Ninety  calendar  days  is  a  reasonable  period of 
time to complete the copy request.  However, copy requests submitted within 90 calendar days of the service member‘s retirement or discharge out-processing 
appointment  will  likely  burden  the  office  responsible  for  providing  the  copy.  Records  managers  must  use  all  available  resources  within  their  means  to  ensure 
RC retiring and discharging Airmen understand to submit their STR copy requests as  early  as  possible.    The  volume  of  electronic  patient  encounter  documents 
generated  from  MTF,  DTF  or  RCMU  visits that  fall  within  the  period  from  the 90-day cut-off copy request date through the Airman‘s MTF, DTF or RCMU out-
processing  date  should  not  be  that  significant.    These  few  documents  should  be reasonably easy to identify and print from AHLTA or CHCS ―on the spot‖ or 
copy  from  the  paper  outpatient  medical  or  dental  records  and  added  to  the  copy package or provided to the member at the time of out-processing. 
5.7.1.10.2.3.  Some  RCMUs  do  not  have  access  to  AHLTA  and/or  CHCS.    For those RCMUs without AHLTA or CHCS access, records managers are required to 
----------------Page (224) Break----------------
  226  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
contact  the  AD  USAF  support  MTF  to  obtain  copies  of  all  AHLTA/CHCS encounters,  ancillary  laboratory  and  radiology  results.    Provide  a  copy  of  the 
Service Member‘s pharmacy prescription medication history only  upon  specific request. 
5.7.1.10.2.4.  Although  the  TAP  program  may  not  be  available  for  many  RC Airmen,  RC  unit  commanders,  first  sergeants,  personnelists,  and  medics  are 
encouraged to inform retiring or discharging RC Airmen of the necessity to obtain a complete copy of their STR as soon as possible. 
5.7.1.11.  STR   Composition   (Documents   to   Copy):      Generally,   the   STR   includes traditional  paper  outpatient  medical  and  dental  documents  stored  in  the  outpatient 
medical  and  dental  records  as  well  as  ancillary  laboratory,  radiology  reports  stored  and PRINTED  from  the  CHCS  as  well  as  outpatient  patient  encounter  notes  and  any  other 
PHI reports, data, or information stored and PRINTED from AHLTA.  Copies of clinical narrative summaries and operation reports from previous inpatient, ambulatory procedure 
visits (APV), and/or MEB actions should already be filed in Part I or III of the member‘s outpatient  record.  However,  MTF  records  managers  or  Release  of  Information  (ROI) 
staff  will  verify  that  any  narrative  summaries  and/or  operation  reports  generated  from past inpatient, APV or MEB actions completed at the same MTF responsible for the STR 
disposition,  are  included  in  the  paper  outpatient  medical  record.    Provide  a  copy  of  the Service Member‘s pharmacy prescription medication history upon specific request. 
5.7.1.11.1.  Patient encounter notes, radiology procedures,  and laboratory test results electronically stored in AHLTA and/or CHCS are expected to be printed and added to 
the  respective  outpatient  medical  or  dental  record  prior  to  copy  generation  and/or forwarding the STR to the AFPC disposition center.  If MTF records personnel do not 
have  access  to  necessary  AHLTA  or  CHCS  systems  to  identify  and  print  patient encounters, radiology reports, and laboratory reports, then the patient‘s PCM support 
staff is expected to complete this requirement and forward the documents to the MTF outpatient medical and/or dental departments for inclusion into the STR. 
5.7.1.11.2.  To   ensure   reasonable continuity   of   care   and   or   DVA   disability evaluation/consideration,  documents  generated  from  civilian  healthcare  providers, 
stored in any MTF health record, are included in the STR.  Examples include: a.  Reports and documents received from civilian referral healthcare providers. 
b.  Reports and documents from TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Prime Remote civilian network providers.  When a service member assigned to a remote unit or GSU is enrolled to a TRICARE 
network PCM, his civilian documents are owned and maintained at the network civilian PCM office.  At the time of the separating or retiring Airman‘s MTF, DTF or RCMU records 
department out-processing appointment, each Airman enrolled to a TRICARE civilian PCM should complete an authorization to obtain healthcare information from the civilian PCM and/or 
any civilian healthcare provider.  These documents should be forwarded to the MTF where the STR is maintained so that ROI staff can make the patient a copy, then include these civilian 
documents into the STR.  MTF records managers are expected to communicate this process to separating and retiring Airmen attending TAP class so ―last minute‖ civilian PCM requests do 
not delay STR disposition. 
----------------Page (225) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   227  
5.7.1.12.  Providing Copies for the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) Program: 5.7.1.12.1.  The  BDD  Program  is  a  joint  initiative  between  the  DVA  and  the  DoD.  
This  program  enables  DVA  representatives  to  help  transitioning  Airmen  assemble and  prepare  their  disability  claim  packages  for  DVA  disability compensation  and 
benefits  review  prior  to  their  service  separation  or  retirement.    The  original  STR  is not  provided  to  the  BDD  office.    Instead,  the  MTF  will  provide  the  member  with  a 
paper copy of the STR at the member‘s request.  The BDD office will only accept a paper  record  copy  at  this  time.   Note: this copy is counted as the member‘s one 
complete copy free of charge. 5.7.1.13.  Collecting and Preparing STRs for Shipment: 
See Attachment 29 for an example of the Active Duty STR Disposition Flow Chart and Attachments 30 and 31 for STR Disposition Process Checklists. 
5.7.1.13.1.  Once  the  LOSS  rosters  are  obtained,  retrieve  the  applicable  outpatient medical records and place them in a staging area separate from the main file located 
within a secure, limited access room.  File the STRs in chronological order according to the Loss Roster shipment date.  This will help ensure the STRs are mailed to AFPC 
by the deadline (i.e., no earlier than 30 days after and no later than 35 days after the member‘s final date of separation). 
5.7.1.13.2.  No later than 20 calendar days after the Airman‘s date of separation, MTF and  DTF  records  personnel  will  ensure  the  dental  treatment  records  for  each 
separating  and  retiring  Airman  are  forwarded to  a  central  MTF  location  where  they will be bundled with the outpatient medical record and staged until ready for mailing 
to AFPC.  Note:  The outpatient medical and dental records for each Airman must be ―bundled‖ together before shipping to the AFPC Records  Disposition  Center.    DO 
NOT MAIL THE OUTPATIENT AND DENTAL RECORDS SEPARATELY. 5.7.1.13.3.  Missing  Records:    With  the  DoD-wide  implementation  of  AHLTA, 
almost  all  Active  Duty  Service  Members  (ADSM)  have  patient  medical  encounters documented electronically.    If  after  an  exhaustive  MTF-wide  search  either  the 
original paper outpatient medical or original dental record(s) cannot be located, there will  likely  still  be  at  least  a  few  electronically  stored  AHLTA  patient  medical 
encounter documents.  In this scenario, MTF records managers are required to locate and  print  the  AHLTA  patient  medical  encounter  documents  and  file  in  a  new 
outpatient medical record jacket.  The record jacket should be labeled ―Volume II‖ and  a  record  of  the  new  volume  must be  documented  in  the  CHCS  MRT  module. 
Records managers must flag the original paper record volume as ―missing‖ in the same  CHCS  MRT  module.    The  process  of  identifying  and  printing  AHLTA  dental 
patient encounter information and filing the printed documents in a new dental record jacket is required for all DTFs with operational AHLTA dental modules.  A Letter of 
Non-Availability  must  be  included  in  the  STR  package  for  the  missing  original volume. 
5.7.1.13.4.  Non-Availability Statement for Missing Original Paper Records: 5.7.1.13.4.1.  If after due diligence, to include contacting the patient‘s previous 
MTF,  either  the  original  paper  dental  or  original  paper  outpatient  medical 
----------------Page (226) Break----------------
  228  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
record(s)  are  missing  and  absolutely  cannot  be  located,  then  include  in  the bundled  package,  a  Letter  of  Non-Availability  indicating  one  or  more  original 
records are missing.  A template for the Letter of Non-Availability is available on the  AF/SG  CoP.    See  Attachment  32  for  the  authorized  format.   Note:  Two 
letters of Non-Availability will not clear the STR from the missing roster.  DVA will not accept two letters of Non-Availability for one individual. 
5.7.1.13.4.2.  The Squadron Commander or Flight Commander responsible for the operational  day-to-day  maintenance  and  storage  of  the  dental  and/or  outpatient 
medical records, as applicable, must wet sign the letter of Non-Availability.  (The signature  block  must  reflect  the  job  title  of  the  person  signing.)    Signature 
delegation is not authorized.  The ANG is authorized to delegate a SNCO to wet sign a letter of Non-Availability. 
5.7.1.13.4.3.  Note:  MTF  records  managers  are  required  to  print  all  patient encounters   from   AHLTA   and   add   to   the   existing   outpatient   and/or   dental 
treatment record at the time of the Airman‘s separation or retirement.  If either the original outpatient medical or dental  records are  missing, create a new AF Form 
2100A series record and add the printed documents to the paper record aka record jacket.    Since  this  new  jacket  constitutes  another  record  volume,  MTF  records 
personnel  must  create  another  medical  volume  in  the  CHCS  MRT  menu  and record the transfer to the AFPC Records Disposition Center just as they would for 
the original record.  The Letter of Non-Availability must be completed to reflect that the original paper record volume is missing. 
5.7.1.13.5.  Air Force Members Empanelled to Other-Service MTFs:  STRs for active duty  service  members  (ADSMs)  are  normally  maintained  at  the  MTF  where  the 
member receives his primary care, regardless of service affiliation.  The health record management officials at the Air Force MTF located nearest to the member‘s Other-
Service  PCM/MTF  location  should  establish  a  local  STR  Support  Agreement  (see Attachment  33  for  example)  with  the Other-Service  MTF.    As  this  is  DoD  Policy, 
MOU verbiage should include both service processes.  The agreement should identify how  the  STRs  will  be  transferred  from  the  Other-Service  MTF.    How  this  is 
accomplished is jointly decided by the MTFs, but acceptable methods include: 5.7.1.13.5.1.  The Other-Service MTF may mail the STR to the nearest AF MTF 
for subsequent mailing to AFPC. 5.7.1.13.5.2.  The  Other-Service  MTF  may  forward the STR  directly  to  AFPC  if 
they do so using the instructions outlined in this document.  Include a copy of the STR disposition instructions with the agreement if this method is chosen. 
5.7.1.13.5.3.  There   may   be   instances   when   the   member   is   assigned   to   a Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) and the responsible Air Force MTF is not 
the nearest MTF to the member‘s Other-Service  PCM/MTF  location.    In  these cares, see rules for managing GSU records in the passages that follow. 
5.7.1.13.6.  Non-Air Force Service Members Empanelled to Air Force MTFs: 5.7.1.13.6.1.  Service   Treatment   Records   for   non-AF   service   members   are 
normally  maintained  at  the  AF  MTF  when  the  member  is  empanelled  to  the  AF 
----------------Page (227) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   229  
MTF.  Unless there is a local STR Support Agreement stating otherwise, STRs for Other-Service  members  should  be  mailed  to  the  applicable  address  included  in 
Attachment  34.    If  a  local  STR  Support  Agreement  is  established  with  another Service,  the  agreement  should  identify  how  the  STR  will  be  transferred  to  the

MEMBERS TO THE AFPC RECORDS DISPOSITION CENTER.  FORWARD AIR FORCE STRs ONLY. 
5.7.1.13.7.  Personnel Assigned to Geographically Separated Units: 5.7.1.13.7.1.  If  the  MTF  identified on  the  Loss  Roster  is  not  the  MTF  that 
maintains the retiring/separating member‘s STR, the Loss-Roster-named  MTF must coordinate with the MTF where the record is regularly maintained in order 
to  ensure  the  STRs  are  mailed  to  AFPC  or  RCMU  by  the  deadline.  (Note:  Names  and  numbers of  POCs  at  each  Air Force  MTF  are  located on  the  AF/SG 
CoP in the ―COLLABORATE‖ section.) 5.7.1.13.7.2.  Once  contacted,  the  MTF  maintaining  the  STR  mails  the  STR  to 
AFPC  in  accordance  with  this  guidance  with  one  exception -- the  shipment container must be labeled with the return address for the Loss-Roster named MTF 
to ensure AFPC recognizes and correctly annotates receipt of the STR. 5.7.1.14.  Packaging and Shipping STRs:

maximum  weight  per  shipping  box  is  50  pounds.    Do  not  bundle  standard  shipping boxes  within  larger  containers  for  shipment  as  the  AFPC  mailroom  will  not  accept 
large or heavy packages or containers.  MTF records personnel will ensure boxes are thoroughly  and  securely  packed,  labeled,  and  taped  for  shipping  so  as  to  prevent 
inadvertent  opening  during  shipment  and  subsequent  loss  of  STRs  or  delays  in arriving at destination. 
5.7.1.16.2.  Envelopes – If the STR  ̳bundle‖ will easily fit into an envelope, one may be used.  Ensure it is securely packed, labeled, and taped for shipping so as to prevent

later than 35 calendar days after the member‘s date of retirement/separation/discharge or  transition to  inactive  status.    It  is  highly  recommended  that  OCONUS  MTFs  not 
using commercially available global delivery services mail the STR on the ―No Earlier Than Date‖ to prevent the STR from arriving late at the AFPC Records 
Disposition Center. 5.7.1.17.2.  DO  NOT  MAIL  A  MEMBER‘S  OUTPATIENT  AND  DENTAL 
RECORDS SEPARATELY; they must be mailed together as a ―bundle.‖ 5.7.1.17.3.  STR  ―bundles‖  of  outpatient  and  dental  records  for  more  than  one

standard  first  class  mail,  certified  mail,  or  other  available  commercially  available option, e.g., FedEx. 
5.7.1.18.2.  If standard first class United States Postal Service (USPS) is used, return receipt  confirmation  or  shipment  via  Certified  Mail  is  required.    These  services  are 
typically  available  via  the  Base  Information  Transfer  System  (BITS)  or  the  Base Information Transfer Center (BITC) at each major installation. 
5.7.1.18.3.  Commercial  priority  mailing  services  are  usually  offered  through  the MTF mailroom. 
5.7.1.18.4.  Records    personnel    are    required    to    keep postage    tracking/arrival confirmation notice permanently or until the OUSD(P&R) and the Services establish

ATTENTION: Medical Records Central Cell 550 C STREET W, SUITE 21 
RANDOLPH AFB TX 78150 5.7.1.19.2.  For  Airman  Transitioning  from  the  Active  Duty  to  Reserve  Component, 
mail the STR to the member‘s gaining RCMU listed on the LOSS Roster and/or the member‘s separation and/or service component transition orders.  If the location of 
the medical unit is not on the orders, access the AF/SG CoP for the list of addresses.  Note: MTF  records  managers  are  prohibited  from  mailing  health  records  for  these 
service members to the DVA. 5.7.1.19.3.  For   service   members   transitioning   from   AD   to   the   Participating 
Individual Ready Reserves (PIRR), mail STRs to the Readiness Management Group (RMG) at Warner Robins, Georgia at the following address: 
RMG/SG 233 N Houston Road, Suite 131A 
Warner Robins, GA 31093 5.7.1.19.3.1.  MTF  records  personnel are  required  to  place  a  copy  of  the  service 
transition orders or AF Form 1288 in the outpatient medical and dental records. 5.7.1.19.3.2.  Annotate  the  LOSS  roster  stating  where  the  STR  was  mailed  and 
why. 5.7.1.20.  MRT Transition in CHCS.  Each time a record is mailed to AFPC, RCMU, or 
the  RMG,  the  action  must  be  documented  in  the CHCS  MRT  function.    Health  records personnel  will  TRANSFER  the  record  in  the  CHCS  MRT  menu  to  the  appropriate 
location. 5.7.1.21.  Handling Clarification Queries from AFPC:  AFPC queries for clarification on 
STRs  (e.g.,  requests  for  missing  documents)  must  receive  immediate  MTF  record management action as AFPC only has a 5-day window from time of STR receipt to ship 
it to the VA. 5.7.1.21.1.  Track AFPC queries and their outcome in a local database.  The method 
is  left  up  to  the MTF  and  could  include  an  electronic spreadsheet,  simple  ledger, or other method. 
5.7.1.21.2.  By AFPC/AFMS agreement, the MTF and/or DTF records managers have only  two  duty  days  from  receipt  of  the  AFPC  inquiry  to  investigate  and  provide  a 
response.    DELAYED    RESPONSES    TO    AFPC    REQUIRE    IMMEDIATE EXPLANATION TO AFMOA/SGAT. 
5.7.1.21.3.  The MTF/DTF may be contacted by phone or e-mail.  MTF/DTF records managers may contact officials at AFPC via telephone (210) 565-1497 or DSN 665-
1497  or  return  e-mail  with  the  results  of  the  inquiry,  whether  or  not  the  record  or missing item was found and when it will be sent to AFPC.  Annotate the results in the 
computer spreadsheet or ledger book.

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   233  
5.7.1.22.  Managing Loose, Late-Flowing, or ―Orphaned‖ Medical Documents Following STR Shipment.  ―Loose, late-flowing, or orphaned‖ medical documents are those medical 
or  dental  documents  discovered  in  the  MTF  or  DTF  after  the  STR has  already  been mailed to AFPC or the departing member‘s guard or reserve medical unit.  This may still 
occur even though the MTF/DTF holds the STRs until at least 30 calendar days after the member‘s date of separation to allow time for the majority of loose documents to be filed 
into the record. 5.7.1.22.1.  After an Airman‘s paper STR is mailed to AFPC, to a RCMU, or to the 
RMG,   late/loose   flowing   documents   must   be   filed   into   the   charge-out   guide containing the member‘s retirement or separation orders. 
5.7.1.22.2.  Remove the charge-out guide after 90 calendar days from the date of the mailing of the original STR, during the normal monthly purge. 
5.7.1.22.3.  If there  are no documents found in the charge-out  guide, remove it from file location and destroy the remaining retirement or separation order. 
5.7.1.22.4.  If   there   are   loose,   late   flowing   documents   found,   then   file   these documents  inside  of  a  new  AF  Form  2100A  series  Outpatient  Health  Record  or  AF 
Form 2100 B-series Dental Health Record ―jacket.‖  Ensure each information box on the medical record cover or jacket is properly addressed and completed.  The AFPC 
Records  Disposition  Center  may  return  records  that  are  not  identified  properly.   Ensure  there  is  a  minimum  of 10  pages  in  the  new  jacket.    Print  and  file  the  most 
recent  AHLTA  patient  encounter  notes  if  needed  to  ensure  the  record  is  at  least  10 pages. 
5.7.1.22.4.1.  Obtain   the   remaining   retirement   or   separation   order   from   the charge-out  guide  and  file  in Section  II  of  the  AF  Form  2100A  series  record 
(ensure it is on top of all other documents) or in the AF Form 2100B series record on the right side of the jacket. 
5.7.1.22.4.2.  Write or stamp the appropriate volume number on the outside of the record jacket, e.g., ―VOLUME 2 of 2 or VOLUME 3 of 3‖ in one-inch block print 
or stamp. 5.7.1.22.4.3.  Since  this  new  jacket  constitutes  another  medical  record  volume, 
MTF records personnel must create another medical record volume in the CHCS MRT menu to satisfy inventory and tracking purposes. 
5.7.1.22.4.4.  Immediately after creating the new volume entry in CHCS, records personnel must either select or create a standardized transfer/disposition entry for 
AFPC matching the original STR disposition action, or they must select or create a  transfer/disposition  entry  for  the  destination  location  from  the  CHCS  MRT 
transfer record menu location listing. 5.7.1.22.4.5.  If  a  CHCS  Label  cannot  be  printed  with  the  correct  20  FMP/SSN, 
hand-writing the data in the patient ID area is acceptable. 5.7.1.22.4.6.  Add the supplemental record jacket to the next shipment box bound 
for  AFPC,  the  destination  RCMU,  or  the  RMG.    Ensure  the  name  and  SSN  for any  supplemental  STRs  appear  on  the  AF  Form  330  inventory  list.    Identify  on

5.7.1.23.  Pre 1 Jan 09 Medical and Dental Records/Loose Documents Processing: 5.7.1.23.1.  The following guidance applies only to records and ―loose, late flowing‖ 
medical documents collected for Airmen who separated/retired before 1 Jan 09.  This is a temporary program for AFPC based on available Air Force Reservist man-days.  
The program will terminate when man-days expire.  Due to limited space and storage capabilities  at  AFPC,  Pre-Jan  09  STRs  are  being  sent  in  phased  shipments.    MTFs 
must wait their turn to ship – all unauthorized shipments will be returned. 5.7.1.23.2.  MTF  records  personnel  are  required to  temporarily  stage  the  outpatient 
and  dental  records  together  in  a  central  records  storage  location,  separate  from  the main MTF file or records room.  Ensure the following steps are taken: 
5.7.1.23.3.  File  all  loose  documents  (including  printed AHLTA  and  CHCS  patient encounters  and  reports)  in  an  appropriate  AF  Form  2100A  or  2100B  series  record 
jacket. 5.7.1.23.4.  If  the  original  outpatient  medical  or  the  dental  treatment  record  is  not 
available,  include  a  Letter  of  Non-Availability  for the  missing  original  record(s).  Ensure  the  letter  is  wet  signed  by  the  Squadron  Commander  or  Flight  Commander 
responsible for the operational day-to-day maintenance and storage of the dental and outpatient  medical  records,  as  applicable.    (The  signature  block  must  reflect  the  job 
title of the person signing). 5.7.1.23.5.  Complete an AF Form 330 along with an inventory list.  (See Attachment 
36 for the list of required items). 5.7.1.23.6.  If obtainable, include a copy of the member‘s retirement,  separation  or 
discharge orders in both the medical and dental record. 5.7.1.23.7.  If  orders  are  not  obtainable,  indicate  this  fact  on  the  inventory  list 
attached to the AF Form 330. 5.7.1.23.8.  Additionally,  annotate  the  AF  Form  330  with  the  following  statement, 
―An extensive search was accomplished to locate retirement, separation, or discharge orders for all included records.  However, we were not able to obtain orders for item 
XX (number) identified in the attached inventory list.‖ 5.7.1.23.9.  AFPC  queries  for  clarification  on  STRs  (e.g.,  requests   for  missing 
documents)   must   receive   immediate   record   management   action.      Follow   the instructions in paragraph 5.9.1.21. 
5.7.1.23.10.  Maintain the records in the central records storage location until directed by  AFMOA/SGAT  to  mail  them  to  the  AFPC  Health  Treatment  Records  Research 
Management  Team.    DO  NOT  MAIL  THESE  RECORDS  UNTIL  DIRECTED  TO DO SO BY AFMOA.  AFPC provides the Shipment Authorization Numbers. 
5.7.1.23.11.  DO   NOT   MAIL   THE   RECORDS   TO   THE   AFPC   CENTRAL DISPOSITION  CENTER.    Instead,  use  the  following  address  for  these  pre-Jan  09 
STRs:

5.7.1.23.12.  If  directly  requested  by  a  DVA  office  for  records  that  fall  within  this category (i.e., pre-January 2009 retirement, separation, or discharge records) the MTF 
may  release  the  STR  (original  outpatient  medical  and  dental  records)  to  the  DVA requestor.    Medical  records  staffs  will  document  this  transfer  in  the  CHCS  MRT 
module. 5.7.1.24.  Active  Duty  and  Reserve  Component  records  disposition  rules  are  subject  to 
frequent  changes.    For  the  latest  information,  contact  the Records  Management  Support Team, AFMOA/SGAT (Health Benefits) via e-mail at afmoa.sgat@us.af.mil. 
5.7.2.  Sequestered/Deceased Member‘s Records.  In the event an STR is sequestered for legal  reasons  or  has  already  been  provided  to  the installation  Casualty  or  Mortuary  Affairs 
office in the event of  an Active  Duty  or RCSM‘s death, MTF records managers must annotate ―SEQUESTERED‖ in the COMMENTS column next to the Airman‘s name on the 
LOSS  Roster.    Records  managers  will  include  the  LOSS Roster  in  the  next-outbound shipment to AFPC.  A Letter of Non-Availability is also required for each sequestered record 
not available at time of shipment. 5.7.2.1.  Service  Treatment  Records  for  Service  Members  Killed  in  Action:    Applies  to 
STRs  of  ADSMs  killed  in  action  during  combat  operations  from  a  deployed  theater  of operations.  Immediately following an ADSM‘s death at an overseas battle zone or 
theater of operations, the on-site Casualty or Mortuary Affairs office is authorized to take possession  of  the  remains  and  prepare  the  body  for  transport  to  the  Dover  AFB  Port 
Mortuary  Facility  as  soon  as  medical  actions  are  complete.    Available  paper  health treatment  documents  and  records  must  be  surrendered  to  the  Mortuary  Affairs/Casualty 
Affairs   representative(s)   upon   request.      Document   the   records   transfer   using   the appropriate electronic records tracking mechanism. 
5.7.2.2.  If outpatient medical or dental treatment records are discovered (at a location not specifically identified as the ADSM‘s home-of-station support MTF), after the body has 
been transported to the Dover AFB Port Mortuary  Facility,  contact the nearest Casualty or  Mortuary  Affairs  unit  responsible  for  arranging  transportation  of  the  remains.    If 
medical and/or dental records cannot be transferred to the nearest Casualty  or Mortuary Affairs  office,  forward  the  medical  record(s)  to  the  MTF  responsible  for  the  regular 
maintenance  and  storage  of  the  deceased  member‘s  record.    Contact  the  deceased Airman‘s  deployed  unit  chain  of command  or  Personnel  Support  for  Contingency 
Operations (PERSCO) unit to ascertain from which installation the Airman deployed.  In the  records  package,  include  a  completed  AF  Form  330,  Records  Transmittal/Request, 
DD Form 2138 Request for Transfer of Outpatient or other appropriate form or letter that informs  the  receiving  MTF  that,  a)  the  ADSM  has  died,  and  b)  informs  the  receiving

5.7.2.3.  Home  Station  MTF  Service  Treatment  Records  Disposition  Responsibility:    If notified  by  an  official  agency  or  unit  (e.g.,  unit  commander  or  chain  of  command 
representative, installation Command Post, Mortuary or Casualty Affairs) that an ADSM was  killed  in  action  while  deployed,  remove  the  deceased Service Member‘s outpatient 
medical  and  dental  records  from  the  main  file  and  contact  the  installation  Casualty  or Mortuary Affairs office.  Print all AHLTA and CHCS patient encounter information and 
place inside the paper STR.  Provide the STR to the Casualty or Mortuary Affairs office upon request.  If the STR is not requested by the Casualty or Mortuary Affairs office or 
Air  Force  Institute  of  Pathology,  forward  the  STR  to  the  AFPC  Records  Disposition Center according to processes identified earlier within this section, no later than 30 days 
following notification of the service member‘s death.  The AFPC Records Disposition Center will forward the STR to the DVA.  Surviving family members may be eligible for 
Service  or  DVA  death  benefits  or  compensation.  The deceased Airman‘s STR may be required as part of the DVA death benefits or compensation evaluation.  If, at any time, 
while preparing to ship the STR to AFPC, the installation Mortuary or Casualty  Affairs unit,  or  Air  Force  Institute  of  Pathology  specifically  requests  the  outpatient  medical  or 
dental records for official purposes, provide the STR and document the transaction in the CHCS  MRT  module.    Provide  a  Letter  of  Non-Availability  to  the  AFPC  Records 
Disposition Center to indicate where the STR was mailed. 5.7.3.  Service  Members  Placed  in  Appellate  Review  Leave  Status  or  When  a  Prisoner  is 
Transported to a Correctional Detention Facility Immediately Following a Trial. 5.7.3.1.  Appellate Review Leave. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 
a punitive service discharge or dismissal may not be executed until the appellate review is completed.    During  this  appellate  process,  Service  Members  are  still  entitled  to  active 
duty  healthcare  benefits  and  are  required  to  remain enrolled  in  TRICARE  Prime.    The appellate process can sometimes be quite lengthy and requires the Service Member to be 
placed on an involuntary excess leave status called ―Appellate Review Leave.‖  The following  guidance  provides  instruction  on  how  to  manage  the  enrollment  and  medical 
records of members on appellate leave status. 5.7.3.2.  Service members subject to appellate review may  relocate and reside anywhere

responsible for transporting the prisoner to the correctional detention facility (in instances when the individual has not already been sent to prison).  If the case is overturned during 
the  appeal  process  and  the  Service  Member  is  returned  to  Active  Duty  status,  the  59 MDW  will  transfer  the  original  STR  to  the  Service  Member‘s  previous  assignment 
support MTF or to another MTF based upon AFPC direction.  Medical records personnel will  not  release  or  forward  the  STR  to  anyone,  any  place,  or  any  agency  without 
obtaining written direction or orders. 5.7.3.16.  Prisoners   Transported   to   a   Correctional   Detention   Facility   Immediately 
Following  Court  Martial  Trial.    Following  the  court‘s  Ruling  and/or  Sentencing,  a Service  Member  may  be  immediately  escorted  to  a  correctional  detention  facility.    The 
appellate review period will occur while the prisoner is confined. 5.7.3.17.  During  the  appellate  review  period,  even  if  a  Service  Member  is  immediately 
transported to a correctional facility, the MTF where the Service Member‘s STR is normally maintained is responsible for forwarding the original STR to the 59th Medical 
Wing  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  (associated  with  appellate  review  record disposition) previously identified in this section. 
5.7.3.18.  Records  personnel  at the Service Member‘s support MTF are prohibited from providing the original STR to any prisoner escort detail.  Instead, provide the escort detail

5.7.6.  Non-NATO Foreign Military Personnel Outpatient Records.  Retire outpatient records for non-NATO foreign military personnel to NPRC 2 years after the end of the calendar year 
of the last date of treatment, IAW AFRIMS Records Disposition Schedule, Series 41 Internet website,  accessible  via  the  Air  Force  Portal  website  and  the  Medical  Record  Tracking, 
Retirement and Retrieval (MRTR2) System located at the AFMS KX Knowledge Exchange, Patient Administration website. 
5.7.7.  Non-military  (including  Uniformed  Service  Family  Member  Health  Records  and Retired Personnel ―Retiree‖ Outpatient) Records.  Air Force MTFs are required to, at least 
annually,  (NLT  the end of the same month from the previous year‘s record retirement) ―retire‖ or purge outpatient medical records for family members and retired personnel to the 
National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) Annex, 1411 Boulder Boulevard, Valmeyer, IL  62295.  If records were last retired in April 2010, the next records retirement process should 
be completed by 30 Apr 2011.  Retire records two years after the end of the calendar year of the last date of treatment.  CAUTION!  Do not use the most current treatment date identified 
inside the paper health record.  Review the patient‘s appointment history in the EHR.  Retire or purge records IAW AFRIMS Records Disposition Schedule, Series 41, accessible via the 
Air  Force  Portal  website  and  the  Medical  Record  Tracking,  Retirement  and  Retrieval (MRTR2)   System   User   Guide   located   at   the   AFMS   Knowledge   Exchange,   Patient 
Administration website. 5.7.8.  Family  Members  of  Service  Members  Assigned  to  Geographically  Separated  Units.  
Outpatient  medical  records  are  usually  maintained  at  the  MTF  for  two  years  after  the calendar  year  in  which  the  last  treatment  occurred.    However,  this  rule  does  not  apply  to 
outpatient  medical  records  for  family  members  of  Service  Members  assigned  to  GSUs.  Although a family member‘s outpatient medical health record may be kept on file at the MTF 
closest  to  the  Service  Member‘s  GSU,  his  or  her  family  members  may  be  enrolled  to TRICARE Prime Remote.  If this is the case, there may be no evidence in either the military 
EHR or paper health record to indicate the family member has received MTF care within the last two years.  If records personnel suspect a family member, for whom the MTF maintains 
an outpatient medical record, may be receiving care at a civilian network healthcare provider, the  record  technician  researching  the  record  must  verify  the  sponsor  and  family  member 
TRICARE enrollment status via DEERS.  If the enrollment information indicates the family member is enrolled into TRICARE Prime remote, then ―flag‖ the outpatient medical record 
according  to  the  instructions  in  paragraph  5.15.    If  the  DEERS  information  indicates  no TRICARE Prime or Prime Remote enrollment, then retire the record(s). 
5.7.9.  Federal  Civilian  Employee  Outpatient  Records.    The  Civilian  Employee  Medical Folder (EMF)  is  a  chronological,  cumulative  record  of  occupational  and  non-occupational 
information pertaining to the health of a civilian employee during the course of employment.  This record consists of personal and occupational health histories, exposure records, medical 
surveillance records, Office of Worker‘s Compensation Programs (OWCP) records, and the documented  notes,  evaluations  and  tests  results  generated  by  healthcare  providers  in  the 
course of examination, treatment and counseling.  Maintain outpatient records of civilian Air Force  employees  until  the  employee  is  transferred  to  another  activity  within  the  Federal 
government or is separated from the Federal Service.  Upon employee transfer or separation, place  the  record  in  SF  66D,  Employee  Medical  Folder,  and  forward  to  the  MPS,  Civilian 
Personnel Section within 10 days of transfer or separation.  It is the responsibility of the MPS 
----------------Page (238) Break----------------
  240  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
to forward the EMF to the appropriate custodian.  However, federal civilian employees must complete  installation  and  unit and/or  installation  out-processing  checklists  similar  to  their 
active duty counterparts (as applied to MTF out-processing requirements).  Typically, Active duty  members  are  required  to  visit  the  installation  OPR  department  to  make  sure  their 
record(s)  and the  record(s)  of  their  family  members  will  be  forwarded  to  the  next  base, regardless  of  any  pre-arranged  MPS-MTF  transfer  process.    Federal  civilian  employees  are 
also  required  to  visit  the  local  servicing  MTF  OPR  department  where  their  EMF  is maintained.  This  process  will  ensure  that  the  MTF  receives  notice  from  the  civilian 
employee   of   an   upcoming   transfer   or   retirement,   regardless   of   any   MPS   records relocation/retirement notification. 
5.7.9.1.  If civilian employee records are found years after the employee has relocated or retired, then: 
5.7.9.1.1.  Ensure records are in a SF 66D.  Each employee will have his own folder. 5.7.9.1.2.  Annotate the SF 66D with the employee‘s last name, first name, middle 
initial  and  SSN  on  the  upper  right  hand  corner - preferably  typed  on  a  white  folder tab. 
5.7.9.1.3.  Box the records in a container which will safely make it through the USPS mailing process. 
5.7.9.1.4.  Create a shipping list for each container.  Detail the contents by name and SSN of each employee‘s record.  A SF 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt is not 
needed. 5.7.9.1.5.  Mail   the   container(s)   to:      National   Personnel   Record   Center,      111 
Winnebago Street, St. Louis, MO  63118-4126. 5.7.9.1.6.  Mail the record containers using standard first class mail, certified mail, or 
other   available   option.      If   standard   first   class   USPS   is   used,   return   receipt confirmation is required.

5.7.10.4.  Extended Ambulatory Records (EARs).  The retirement rules for EARs are the same as those for inpatient records.  For teaching MTFs, the EAR should be retired five 
years following the end of the calendar year of the last documented episode of care unless a  waiver  to  retire  earlier  has  been  approved  by  the  AF  Records  Officer  and  NPRC.  
Contact  AFMOA/SGAT  for  assistance  when  requesting  a  waiver.    For  non-teaching facilities,  the EAR  will be  retired  one  year after  the end  of  the calendar  year of  the last 
documented episode of care. 5.7.10.4.1.  Retire the EAR folder to NPRC along with the inpatient records and any 
applicable fetal monitoring strips (i.e., in the same box.) 5.7.10.4.2.  Place  the  EAR  folder behind  any  fetal  monitoring  strips  for  that  patient, 
or behind the applicable inpatient record folder if there are no fetal monitoring strips. 5.7.10.4.3.  If the patient does not have an inpatient record but does have an EAR, the 
EAR is still included in the shipment of inpatient records. 5.7.10.5.  Fetal  Monitoring  Strips  (FMS).    Retire  the  FMS  to  NPRC IAW  AFRIMS

eligible‖  or  eligible  for  care  under  more  than  one  patient  category.    There  are  several instances when one individual may be ―dual eligible‖ for care.  Refer to paragraph 4.10. for 
additional  information  regarding  multiple  ―same-patient‖  dual  eligibility situations.  However, for this section, the two most notable dual eligible scenarios that usually apply to 
medical records are covered: 5.10.1.1.  A  dependent  who  is  also  a  member  of  the  RC.    Usually,  in  this  instance,  the 
dependent  is  a  spouse  of another  active  duty  or  retired  military  member.  However, another possibility, may indicate that the dependent is a child (son or daughter); under 21 
years of age or under 23 years of age if enrolled in a full-time college program. 5.10.1.2.  The  second  likely  scenario  may  be  a  dependent  spouse  who  is  also  a  retired 
military member. 5.10.2.  Generally, medical records personnel should create a record based upon the highest 
level of eligibility.  If a cross-reference situation exists, specifically for family members who are also RCSMs, locate the block labeled, ―Specify Service & Grade for Military & Retired 
Military Member,‖ near the middle of the front of the outpatient medical record jacket.  Of the three categories, select the NONMILITARY  category.  This is the selection that should 
correspond to the patient‘s primary MTF dependent empanelment status.  Then blot the corresponding square/block.  Next, print the member‘s dependent status and his/her own SSN 
here and their status as a member of the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard, or other 
----------------Page (244) Break----------------
  246  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
multi-service Reserve or AGR/Guard component as appropriate.  Additionally, print in black felt-tip marker or stamp the words, ―CROSS-REFERENCE‖ in 2-inch  block  letters  on  the 
upper left side of the front of the jacket.  See paragraph 4.10 for guidance on creating records on patients with multiple eligibility. 
5.10.3.  Keep  in  mind  that  outpatient  medical  and  dental  records  for  (CAT  A)  RCSMs  are usually maintained with the member‘s reserve unit.  However, if the RCSM is also a family 
member-dependent,  another  outpatient  medical  record  should  be  created  at  the  servicing MTF to document all medical care the patient received under the dependent patient category. 
The  following  provides  guidance  for  establishing  two  record  volumes – using  000-00-0000 as the patient‘s SSN and 999-99-9999 as the sponsor‘s SSN: 
5.10.3.1.  Volume   1   will   be   the   PRIMARY   record   used   for   the   DEPENDENT information  (30/999-99-9999).    Dependent  documentation  will  be  filed in  this  record 
jacket  (99-RED).    The  label  should  be  the  printed  label  from  CHCS  (30/999-99-9999).  Write ―CROSS-REFERENCE‖ on the cover and annotate ARC/AD FMP/SSN 20/000-
00-0000. 5.10.3.1.1.  File the record in the main central file WITH a Charge-out Guide.  Inside 
the guide place a word document referring to the separate RC record, e.g., ―STOP! This member is also a Reservist/IMA/ANG Member.  Separate RC record maintained 
on xxxxxx shelf.‖ 5.10.3.1.2.  In the small pocket where the AF Form 250 would go, print/place an extra 
label from CHCS that states where to re-file the guide. 5.10.3.2.  Volume 2 will be the record used for the RC/AD paperwork (20/000-00-0000).  
Activated  RCSM  documentation  will  be  filed  in  this  jacket  (00-ORANGE).    The  label can  be  handwritten  OR,  if  printed  label  from  CHCS  is  used,  cover  the  30/999-99-9999 
FMP/SSN  with  a  label  or  white  tape  and  annotate  the  correct  FMP/SSN for  this  record (20/000-00-0000). 
5.10.3.2.1.  Write ―CROSS-REFERENCE‖ on the cover and annotate ―RC/AD FMP/ SSN 20/000-00-0000. 
5.10.3.2.2.  File the record in a separate location from the main central file. 5.10.3.3.  When records are retrieved for appointments, pull both volumes, the dependent 
record  and  the  RC/AD  record,  and  wrap  a  rubber-band  around  both  record  volumes.  Ensure the clinic staff knows in which record to annotate the encounter. 
5.10.4.  Military  retired  patients  who  are  also  eligible  for  care  as  a  dependent  spouse  may produce a unique situation when selecting appropriate CHCS automated system registration 
formats and when creating the corresponding outpatient medical record.  Generally, medical records  for  dual  or  multiple  healthcare  eligibility  patients  should  be  created  using  the  FMP 
and SSN that corresponds to highest level of  eligibility or  according to the patient category that is most advantageous to the patient. 
5.10.5.  If  a  beneficiary  has  received  medical  care  under  a  previous  social  security  number (SSN)  as  a  result  of  remarriage  to  another  military  sponsor,  record  forms  filed  under  the 
former  SSN  should  be  consolidated  under  the  current  sponsor  SSN.    Once  the  patient  has been registered in CHCS under the current sponsor‘s SSN, merge the old and new patient 
----------------Page (245) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   247  
file.  For future inquiries, a cross-reference from the old number to the new number should be indicated in the outpatient files as well as in the current automated system. 
5.10.6.  A temporary or ―pseudo‖ SSN may be created for beneficiaries without a SSN.  This process  occurs  in  DEERS  when  the  personnel  technician  issues  an  ID  card  or  enters  the 
beneficiary  into  DEERS.    Either  a  Foreign  Identification  Number  (FIN)  or  a  Temporary Identification  Number   (TIN)  is   generated.    See  paragraph  4.9.  for   more  information 
regarding the creation of ―pseudo‖ SSNs, TINs, or FINs. 5.10.7.  Select the appropriate AF Form 2100A series according to the last two digits of the 
applicable  SSN.   Note:  File  outpatient  civilian  emergency  records  by  SSN  in  a  manila folder.    Maintain folders  separately  from  the  main  file  if  desired.    However,  they  must  be 
interfiled by SSN with the rest of the records when retired to NPRC. 5.10.8.  Maintain civilian employee medical records in manila folders or SF 66D.  Place the 
record in SF 66D when the employee transfers to another Federal agency or is separated from Federal Service.  Send the record to the civilian personnel office (CPO).  Civilian employees 
[including  Air Reserve  Technicians  (ART)]  who  are  also  members  of  an  RC  will  have  one medical record maintained as indicated in paragraph 5.14.  The only exception will be if the 
individual is not employed as a civilian at the same base where his/her RC unit is assigned.  In these cases, a civilian medical record will be maintained as described in the beginning of 
this paragraph.  Civilian employees who are also assigned to a PRP/PSP or Sensitive Duties Program  position  or  job will  have  one  medical  record  maintained  as  indicated in  paragraph 
5.12.5.9. until such time as they are removed from the program or are transferred to another federal agency or separated from federal service.

5.11.3.  Print the first name, middle initial, and last name of the patient in the space provided with  a  black  pen  or  black  felt-tip  marker.   Address  labels  prepared  by  the  Personnel  Data 
System  may  be  used  to  provide  names  of  military  personnel.    DO  NOT  use  pencil  for  any entry except rank.  Always place information in the upper right-hand corner of the cover in 
the patient ID area. 5.11.4.  Print the sponsor‘s SSN in the preprinted blocks in the upper right-hand corner of the 
record. 5.11.4.1.  Print the family member prefix in the two circles next to the SSN.  Check the 
TRICARE DEERS website for the DEERS Dependent Suffix (DDS) for the patient or if not available, number in birth date order for family member children. 
5.11.4.2.  The FMP will not change as long as the patient is still associated with the same sponsor and SSN. 
5.11.4.3.  When a military member marries a person with children, assign family member prefix numbers in sequence following the last family member prefix already assigned to 
children  of  the  sponsor  (if  any).    Assign  the  oldest  child  the  next  number  in  numerical sequence, etc. 
5.11.4.4.  Spouse Prefix Assignment:  Assign the family member prefix ―30‖ to the first spouse  authorized  care.    If  the  member  remarries  due  to  spousal  death,  divorce,  etc., 
assign the number ―31‖ to the next authorized current spouse.  Increase prefix numbers by 1 (e.g., 32, 33) for any additional dependent spouse authorized care.  Only one current 
dependent spouse is authorized medical care. 5.11.4.5.  Un-remarried Former Spouses:  All un-remarried former spouses are now self-
sponsored.  Un-remarried former spouses who have met the requirements in accordance with  AFI  36-3026V1_IP  are  treated  in  the  MTF  as  their  own  sponsor.    Create  medical 
records for these patients using a ―20‖ FMP and the un-remarried spouse‘s own SSN.  If the patient‘s previous record, filed under the deceased sponsor‘s SSN, is still in the file, 
remove the documents and place in this new record.  Annotate previous folder with cross reference to new folder.  If the patient is still in CHCS under the deceased sponsor‘s SSN, 
work  with  the  Systems  Office  to  correct  this.    See  paragraph  2.16.  for  more  definitive information regarding authorized care for former spouses of military members. 
5.11.5.  Standard Folder Markings:  Blot out the ½ inch square block, along the right edge of the rear leaf of the folder that corresponds to the sponsor‘s last SSN digit.  Use a black felt-
tip marker or ½ inch-wide black tape.  If a marker is used, be sure to darken the digit block on the reverse side of the record jacket.  For tape, cover the appropriate digit on the front side 
of the folder, then fold an equal amount of ½ inch-wide tape to the rear side of the folder and cover the digit on the reverse.  Keep tape cuts neat and even. 
5.11.5.1.  Do not make any entries in the small preprinted, numbered blocks, the ―R‖ and ―S‖ blocks at the top of the folder, or the ―R‖ block on the side of the folder (these are for 
Army use only). 
----------------Page (247) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   249  
5.11.5.2.  On the front leaf cover, on the right side of the record jacket, blot out the year that  corresponds  to  the  patient‘s  most  recent  documented  visit  with  a  black  felt-tip 
marker.   Note:  Attach  AF  Form  2700L  Health  Record  Year  Grid,  to  AF  Form  2100A series.    Do  not  prepare  another  folder  if  the  available  year  selections  on  the  original 
record jacket fill-up.  Place AF Form 2700L over the old year markings. 5.11.5.3.  Located near the center of the outside of the record jacket, in the block labeled, 
Specify Service & Grade for Military & Retired Military Member, select the appropriate category,  blot the corresponding block, and document the patient‘s status.  Enter the 
Service  and  rank  for  active  duty  and  retired  military  personnel.    Enter  the  country  for non-US military personnel.  (A copy of the non-US military member‘s orders should be 
placed in the health record).  Use pencil for rank only.  For family members who are also members of an Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard, write the member‘s own SSN 
here as well as their status as a member of the ARC/ANG, or other multi-service Reserve or AGR/Guard component as appropriate.  Additionally, print in black felt-tip marker or 
stamp the words, ―CROSS-REFERENCE‖ in 2-inch block letters on the upper left side of the front of the jacket. 
5.11.6.  PRP/PSP,  or  Sensitive  Duties  Program  Folder  Markings:  Use  RED  permanent marker or RED tape instead of black to identify a PRP/PSP member‘s folder.  Cover the 
appropriate last SSN digit (both sides of the record jacket) located along the folder‘s right edge. 
5.11.6.1.  Stamp or label the outside of the record jacket with the abbreviation ―PRP‖ or ―PSP‖ in 2-inch RED block letters.  The stamp marking should be placed on the left hand 
side of the front of the record jacket to identify persons who participate in the Personnel Reliability Program.  Cover the red marking with a black marking or black tape when a 
member is removed from the program. 5.11.7.  Aerospace  or  Flight  Medicine  Record  Markings:    To  help  identify  patients  in  the 
categories listed in paragraph 5.13.5., blot out with black felt-tip marker or place a ½ inch-wide strip of black tape along the right side of the folder beginning at the bottom of the ―9‖ 
block and end at the bottom of the folder.  Cover the ―R‖ and ―S‖ blocks.  One inch-wide black tape may also be used.  If using 1 inch-wide tape, place the tape on the folder so that 
half of the strip  folds to the rear side of the folder.   If a marker is used,  mark out the same distance on the rear of the folder jacket.  If the record is filed in a filing cabinet instead of on 
a shelf, apply another narrow strip of black tape to the top edge of the rear folder leaf.  Place the tape strip over the left side of the first numerical digit block of the sponsor‘s last 4 digits 
of the SSN.  Place the tape on the folder so that half of the strip folds to the rear side of the folder.  Never cover the FMP or SSN. 
5.11.7.1.  Stamp or label the outside of the record jacket with the acronym ―FLY‖ in 2-inch BLACK block letters.  The stamp marking should be placed on the left hand side of 
the  front  of  the  record  jacket  to  identify  persons  who  participate  in  an  aerospace/flying program or dependents of persons who participate in an aerospace/flying program. 
5.11.8.  Stamping  or  labeling  the  front  cover  of  the  medical  record  with  any  large-letter identifiers  OTHER  than  a)  FLY,  b)  PRP  or  PSP,  c)  CROSS-REFERENCE,  d)  with  infant-
adoption  related  notifications  (see  paragraph  4.3.)  or,  e)  MEDICATION  ALLERGIES  is discouraged.

5.11.9.  If the member is a food handler, the Force Health Management office enters the date of  the  current  food  handler  examination  in  pencil  on  the  appropriate  line  of  the  preprinted 
format. 5.11.10.  If the  patient  is  allergic  to  medication,  display  this  information  prominently  under 
the patient identification data on the right hand side of the folder. 5.11.11.  Attach the CHCS MRT bar code label to the health record folder in the upper right 
hand corner.  See the MRTR2 User Guide for instructions on label requirements. 5.11.12.  Acknowledgement of Notice of Privacy Practices Procedures (NoPP).  Each patient 
will  receive  a  copy  of  the  MHS  NoPP.    See  Chapter  6  for  additional  information  on providing the notice and documenting receipt. 
5.12.  Contents of the Outpatient Record. 5.12.1.  Outpatient  records  must  contain  enough  information  to  identify  the  patient,  support 
the  diagnosis/condition,  justify  the  care,  treatment,  and  service,  accurately  document  the results of care, treatment and service rendered, and promote continuity of care.  Documents 
will  contain  the  name  and  location  of  the  MTF  maintaining  the  record  to  ensure  the document  is  sent  to  the  proper  MTF.    The  documents  will  also  contain  the  name  of  the 
outpatient record location. 5.12.2.  Embossed  plastic cards  may  be  used  to  record  patient  identification  information  on 
forms.  Each document in the record contains, as a minimum, patient‘s name, family member prefix,  full  SSN  under  which  the  record  is  to  be  filed,  name  of  the  MTF  maintaining  the 
patient‘s record,  and  name  of  the  outpatient  record  location.    The  only  exception  is  the display sheet on which laboratory and x-ray slips are filed.  Since the individual slips contain 
the necessary data, it is not necessary to repeat identification information on the same sheet.  However, if the information is not there, it needs to be added.  The patient‘s mailing address 
may be added to any document. 5.12.3.  Paperwork  Filing  Order  for  the  AF  Form  2100A  Series,  Health  Record-Outpatient 
(four-part  folder).  The  AF  Form  2100A  series  is  divided  into  four  sections.    Section  I  is located on the left side of the folder immediately inside the front cover, with the fastener at 
the bottom. Sections II and III are located on the middle flap of the folder, with fasteners at the  top.    Section  IV  is  located  inside,  back  cover,  with  the  fastener  at  the  top  or  bottom.  
Folders  are  prepared  for  new  patients,  or  when  the  present  folder  no  longer  protects  the contents as intended.  Forms are filed in each section in the order as listed in Attachment 9 
for  section  I,  Attachment  10  for  section  II.    Careful  attention  must  be  paid  to  ensure  inter-related  documents  for  the  same  episode  of  care  or  subsequent  referral  care  documents  are 
filed  on  top  of  the  initial  encounter  document.  For  example,  place  subsequent  DD  Form 2161,  Referral  for  Civilian  Medical  Care,  SF  513,  Consultation  Report,  or  AF  Form  1535, 
Physical  Therapy  Consult,  on  top  of  the  SF  600  that  documented  the  initial  encounter.    SF 600s from single-visit encounters, with no other associated supporting paperwork, should be 
filed  in  chronological  order,  most  current  on  top.    See  Attachment  11  for  placement  of documents within section III and refer to Attachment 12 for documents filed in section IV. 
5.12.4.  Electronically generated forms.

5.12.4.1.  Clinical  Optimization  for  Military  Provider  AHLTA  Satisfaction  Strategy (COMPASS).    The  COMPASS  program  offers  a  synergistic  approach  to  maximizing 
provider efficiency.  The COMPASS solution takes full advantage of new and improved alternate input method (AIM) forms and automated data capture templates and processes 
designed  to  increase  patient-provider  interaction,  reduce  time  spent  writing  notes, improve note readability, and standardize documentation throughout the clinic.  Although 
the  COMPASS  AIM  workflow  solution  is  still  in  the  preliminary  phase  of  deployment, expect  expanded  data  documentation  applicability  and  integration  with  the  DoD‘s 
automated EHR. 5.12.4.2.  No  matter  the  form  automation  mechanism,  when  electronically  generated 
forms are used in place of SF, DD, or AF forms, each automated form must be a mirror image of the non-automated form and contain the statement ―SF, DD or AF Form XXXX 
(EF)  [name  and  producer/vendor  (if  any)  of  the  software used].‖  See Section 5A for guidance on overprinted and electronically generated forms. 
5.12.5.  Documenting  the  DD  Form  2766,  Adult  Preventative  and  Chronic  Care  Flowsheet for Active Duty Service Members – Continuity of Care Documentation. 
5.12.5.1.  The  DD  Form  2766,  Adult  Preventive  and  Chronic  Care  Documentation Flowsheet is the primary folder used to document medical and dental treatment for active 
duty, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and deployable federal civilian employees while in a deployed environment.  The original outpatient medical and dental records for 
each  deployed  Active  Duty,  Reserve  Component  (RC)  Service  Member  and  deploying federal employee remain at the host base.   During a deployment, the cardstock DD Form 
2766  is  the  only  authorized  folder  used  to  document  a  Service  Member  or  federal employee‘s adult preventative and chronic care history.  During non-deployment periods 
the DD Form 2766 is filed inside the Service Member‘s outpatient medical record.   Federal civilian employees who have not deployed in support of a contingency operation 
will not have a DD Form 2766. 5.12.5.2.  Automated  Alternatives:    The  Air  Force  Medical  Services  Preventive  Health 
Assessment   and   Individual   Medical   Readiness   (PIMR)   application   and/or   (fully operational)  automated  DD  Form  2766  mechanism  or  similar  type  automated  data 
capture  module  or  AIM  operated  from  or  within  a  standardized  Air  Force  or  MHS electronic  health  record  may  be  used  in  place  of  DD  Form  2766  and  all  continuation 
forms. 5.12.5.2.1.  The  COMPASS  Core  2.0  AIM  template  in  AHLTA  will  serve  as  the 
initial  intake  form  for  all  primary  care  visits  (both  active  duty  and  non  active-duty) and  serves  as  the  primary  mechanism  for  communicating  ―continuum  of  care‖ 
information between healthcare team members and MTFs. 5.12.5.3.  The  electronic  PIMR  DD  Form  2766  is  the official  electronic  DD Form  2766 
for  Active  Duty,  Reserve  Component,  and  deploying  federal  civilian  employees.    In accordance  with  DoDI  6490.03,  Deployment  Health,  August  11,  2006,  each  PIMR  DD 
Form 2766 contains a relevant master problem list or summary of  care,  IMR (including immunization  history)  and  deployment  related  medical  history  report.    The  PIMR  DD 
Form  2766  is  populated  with  continuum of  care  information  (past  medical  and  surgical information,  family  history,  medications,  social  history  and  required  relevant  clinical 
----------------Page (250) Break----------------
  252  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
preventive   services)   from   available   sources,   e.g.,   COMPASS   core   AIM   forms, standardized  electronic  health  record  DD  Form 2766  data,  and  information  from  the 
cardstock DD Form 2766. 5.12.5.4.  The  electronic  PIMR  DD  Form  2766  will  be  updated  during  the  annual  PHA 
and/or  from  information  obtained  from  pre  and  post-deployment  questionnaires,  patient interviews,  patient-provider  encounters,  clinical  reviews,  and  updated  prior  to  any 
Service  Member  Permanent  Change  of  Station.  The  most  current  version  of  the  PIMR DD Form 2766 and DD Form 2766C (Immunization History Continuation Form) will be 
printed and placed into the cardstock DD Form 2766 (secured with the metal prongs) for all  Active  Duty  and  RCSMs  during  their  annual  Preventive  Health  Assessment,  during 
pre-deployment screening, and prior to completing PCS out-processing.  Insert a copy of the most current DD Form 2766 and DD Form 2766C into the cardstock DD Form 2766 
for any Federal civilian employee during the pre-deployment screening process. 5.12.5.5.  Obsolete copies of other automatically generated DD Form 2766 documents are 
to be removed and destroyed when new PIMR DD Form 2766 printouts are inserted.  No medical  information  is  to  be  hand-written  on  a  PIMR  DD  Form  2766  generated 
document.  Information collected on the card stock DD 2766 during a deployment will be merged  with  the  electronic  PIMR  DD  Form  2766  within  30  days  following  a  Service 
Member‘s return from deployment IAW DoDI 6490.03. 5.12.5.6.  MTF  providers  and  clinical  support  staff  are  not  required  to  review  or  update 
the cardstock DD Form 2766 at each patient visit.  If obsolete information is handwritten on  the  card  stock  DD  Form  2766,  it  should  be  erased  (if  pencil)  or  lined  out  with  one 
single straight line, and initialed with the reviewer‘s name initials and date to indicate the information is no longer valid. The form should then be marked (with a  stamp or hand-
printed in bold letters) ―Data Transferred to Electronic PIMR DD Form 2766 in PIMR on __________‖  (insert  date  of  transfer)  at  the  top  of  each  card  stock  page.                                           
(Date) 5.12.5.7.  Absent  an  automated  DoD  solution  that  captures  and  transfers  the  same 
preventive  and  chronic  care  medical  information  from  non-combat  host  MTFs  to  a deployed theater location, the card stock DD Form 2766 will remain a permanent part of 
the paper-based outpatient medical record. 5.12.5.8.  Immediately    following    the    pre-deployment    clinical    review/screening, 
photocopy  all sections of the cardstock DD Form 2766 and  file the copy  in the original outpatient medical record. 
5.12.5.9.  For  Service Members  assigned  to  Sensitive  Duties  Programs  (e.g.,  PRP  and PSP),  MTF  records  personnel  will  attach  an  AF  Form  745,  Sensitive  Duties  Program 
Record Identifier inside the DD Form 2766 cardstock record.  Stamp ―PRP‖ or ―PSP‖ in 2-inch  letters  on  the  cover  of  the  DD  Form  2766  prior  to  a  Service  Member‘s 
deployment. 5.12.6.  Documenting    Preventative    and    Chronic    Care    for    Non-Active    Duty    Adult 
Beneficiaries. 5.12.6.1.  The  COMPASS  Core  2.0  AIM  template  in  AHLTA  will  serve  as  the  initial 
intake  form  for  all  primary  care  visits  (for  both  active  duty  and  non  active-duty  adult 
----------------Page (251) Break----------------

patients) and serves as the primary mechanism for communicating ―continuum of care‖ information between healthcare team members and MTFs.  Use of the COMPASS Core 
2.0 template/form will replace the need for completing the card-stock DD Form 2766 for non-active duty adult beneficiaries.  All discontinued DD 2766 forms, already filed in the 
medical  record,  must  remain  in  the  outpatient  medical  record.    Do  not  destroy  old  or seemingly irrelevant medical documents. 
5.12.7.  Documenting  and  Filing  the  DD  Form  2882,  Pediatric  and  Adolescent  Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet. 
5.12.7.1.  This form will be used for all Department of Defense (DoD) TRICARE Prime pediatric and  adolescent  beneficiaries  to  provide  continuity  of  care  in  the  TRICARE 
system.    The  form  may  also  be  used  for  non-TRICARE  Prime  pediatric  and  adolescent beneficiaries  at  the  discretion  of  the  MTF  or  provider.    The  DD  Form  replaces  the  AF 
Form 4320.  All AF Forms 4320 and AF Forms 3923 already in the medical records must remain  in  the  outpatient  medical  record.    Do  not  destroy  old  or  seemingly  irrelevant 
medical documents. 5.12.7.2.  Pages  one  and  two  are  mandatory  for  all  newborns  and  all  current  Service 
specific forms used for the summary of care that are worn, torn or which otherwise need to be replaced. 
5.12.7.3.  Pages 3 and 4 are used to track immunizations and are available for use if there is not a Service specific form currently in use. 
5.12.7.4.  Pages  5,  6,  and  7  are  designed  to  track  clinical  preventive  services  (CPS),  as identified  by  the  current  edition  of  the  US  Preventive  Services  Task  Force  (USPSTF) 
Guide  to  Clinical  Preventive  Services  and  the  TRICARE  Prime  benefit package.    This form  is  not  intended  to  be  used  as  current  age-specific  recommendations  for  care  of 
newborns through adolescents ages (0 - 18 years). 5.12.7.5.  The  DD  Form  2882  is  available  in  hard  copy  only.    To  obtain  copies  of  the 
current form, contact the MTF Forms Management Office. 5.12.7.6.  Pending  completion  and  AF/SG  approval  of  the  automated  COMPASS  Core 
AIM Form (Pediatric version), the form will replace DD Form 2882 for documentation of pediatric and adolescent preventive and chronic medical information. 
5.12.8.  Documenting and Transcribing Information from Historical Patient Preventative and Chronic Care Flow Sheets. 
5.12.8.1.  Health  records  support  personnel  are  not  authorized  to  transcribe  pertinent information from the old form to the new form.  Only the patient‘s PCM medical staff are 
authorized to transcribe pertinent medical information from this document to the EHR or to another DD Form 2766. 
5.12.8.2.  Do  not  remove  or  destroy  the  old  AF  Form  1480,  Summary  of  Care,  1480A, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care  Flowsheet (aka Summary of Care); DD Form 2766; 
or  DD  Form  2882,  Pediatric  and  Adolescent  Preventive  and  Chronic  Care  Flowsheet from  the  paper  outpatient  medical  record.    Keep  these  documents  in outpatient  medical 
record.  Instead, for an outdated DD Form 2766 (from the current filing position in part I of  the  AF  Form  2100A  Series  Outpatient  Medical  record),  close  the  form  and  then

  254  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
"double hole punch" the bottom of the form/folder and replace the form back into Section I with page 1 of 4 face-up. 
5.12.8.3.  For Service Members, place the new DD Form 2766 on top of the old form so that   the   form   can   be   opened inside   the   medical   record.      Non-active   duty   adult 
beneficiaries  do  not  need  a  replacement  DD  Form  2766 – see  automated  COMPASS AIM form. 
5.12.9.  Unauthorized Storage of ―Second, Back-up, or Shadow Files‖ Maintained in Clinical Work  Centers.  Serious  patient  safety  issues  may  develop  if  MTF  work  centers  maintain 
copies of their patients‘ permanent medical records and/or documents separately from where the official medical and dental records are regularly maintained.  Storing medical information 
which  documents,  illustrates,  depicts,  or  describes  the  same  clinical  data,  including  but not limited to outpatient encounters, dental encounters, inpatient healthcare, same day surgeries, 
ambulatory surgery, or diagnostic care may not be stored in more than one MTF location. 5.12.9.1.  Official   medical   records   and   medical   documents   created   to   permanently 
document  the  healthcare  provided  to  a  patient  are  maintained  in  either  the  EHR  or officially  recognized  rigid,  cardstock  record  (for  which  an  approved  Air  Force  or  DoD 
record/form  number  exists).    Copies  of  original  medical  or  dental  treatment  records, sometimes referred to a ―back-up‖ or ―shadow files‖ kept in any work center for the 
purpose of convenience, ―quick reference availability,‖ or to maintain a clinic ―mini-file‖ system, are unauthorized. 
5.12.9.2.  The  minimum  official  record  sets  used  by  the  AFMS  include:  outpatient medical,  dental  treatment,  inpatient,  ambulatory  procedure,  extended  ambulatory,  and 
mental  health  record  folders.    Any  officially  recognized  paper/cardstock  record(s)  are stored  with  like  records  in  a  central  or  decentralized,  secure,  limited  access  records  file 
room(s).    Following  each  individual  treatment  or  patient  encounter,  and  only  after  all necessary administrative and/or coding or quality review processes are complete, original 
medical  or  dental treatment  forms  or  records  documenting  provider-patient  interaction, will be placed or filed into the patient‘s EHR or applicable cardstock medical record.  
Copies will not be maintained anywhere. 5.13.  Filing Outpatient Records. 
5.13.1.  ―Terminal Digit‖ Filing System:  File records by SSN, according to a terminal digit, color-coded  and  blocked  filing  system.    Divide  the  central  files  into  100  equal  sections.  
Establish a minimum of 100 files guides identifying primary Terminal Digit numbers, ―00‖ through ―99.‖ 
5.13.2.  File  record  folders  in  numerical  sequence  according  to  their  secondary  numbers within each section.  The secondary number is the pair of digits immediately to the left of the 
primary number. 5.13.3.  All  outpatient  records  and  forms  will  be  maintained  in  a  single  numerical  file  in  a 
central  location  except  when  the  MTF  Commander  authorizes  decentralization  of  the numerical file to the patient‘s major primary or family care team location or to the Flight and 
Operational  Medicine  Clinic,  if  applicable.  See  5.13.5.  The  numerical  files  of  personnel assigned  to  the  PRP,  PSP  or  any  other  sensitive  duty  program  are  also  maintained  in  a 
separate secured location. See 5.13.6.  In MTFs with authorized decentralized records rooms,

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   255  
the CHCS  MRT  function  will  identify  where  the  numerical  file is  regularly  stored  and  will document inter-facility borrower history.  Use of AF Form 614s will not be required unless 
the  CHCS  MRT  function  is  not  used  or  the  MTF  Records  Custodian deems  non-use appropriate. 
5.13.4.  Establish local procedures to perform an annual inventory all Active Duty Air Force records  by  31  March.    Medical  records  personnel  will  contact  the  local  MPS  and  obtain  a 
roster of all assigned and/or attached active duty personnel.  Sort the roster by terminal digit order.  If missing records are discovered during the initial inventory audit, records personnel 
will  perform  monthly  follow-up  audits  until  the  missing  record(s)  are  retrieved  or  located.  Missing records must be added to the Global Records Search until found. 
5.13.5.  Flight  and  Operational  Medicine  Records:    If  authorized  by  the  MTF  Commander, outpatient records for Airmen and family members empanelled to the Flight and Operational 
Medicine Clinic  may  be  maintained  in  the  Flight  and  Operational  Medicine  Clinic.    Flight and Operational Medicine records are usually maintained on individuals assigned to: air crew 
duty, missile launch duty, air traffic control duty, physiological training duty, parachute duty, and  weapons  control  duty,  and  on  the  family  members  of  Airmen  on  flight  status  who  are 
empanelled to the Flight Clinic. 5.13.6.  Outpatient  medical  and  dental  treatment  records  for  personnel  assigned  to  the PRP, 
PSP, or any other sensitive duty program will be maintained in a separate, secured location.  Again,  as  mentioned  in  paragraph  5.13.3.,  proper  use  and  management  of  the  CHCS  MRT 
module will provide MTF personnel with the mechanism to determine where a ―paper‖ medical record is located. 
5.13.7.  Outpatient  and  dental  health  records  for  authorized  family  members  and  sponsors who reside  at  locations  outside  of  approved  MTF  TRICARE  PRIME  enrollment  catchment 
areas or who are assigned to a) USAF Recruiting Service posts, b) ROTC units, c) GSUs, and d)  authorized  TRICARE  Prime  Remote  locales,  and  e)  health  records  for  TRICARE  Prime 
family  members  enrolled  to  civilian  PCMs  will  be  maintained  at  the  nearest  MTF  to  the member/sponsor‘s  remote  assignment  location  or  home  address, whichever   is   more 
advantageous  to  the  sponsor  and  family  member(s).    There  may  be  instances  when  the responsible AF MTF is not the nearest MTF to where the member is assigned or the family 
member  is  enrolled.    In  these  instances,  the  responsible  AF  MTF  must  coordinate  with  the nearest MTF maintaining the records to ensure the records are correctly processed when the 
member retires, separates, PCS‘s to another location or enrolls to another MTF.  Exception:  Outpatient and dental records for active duty members attached to GSUs who are assigned to 
highly critical or sensitive duty programs are maintained in a separate, secured location IAW paragraph 5.13.6.  Health records for GSU Service Members are maintained IAW paragraph 
5.15. 5.13.8.  ―Splitting‖ Records aka Closing Record Volumes:  In order to optimize file space for 
current and future outpatient records, it is permissible to ―split‖ or separate outpatient records that consist of more than one volume. 
5.13.8.1.  If an additional record volume is needed or to separate the current volume from older  volumes,  records  personnel  will  mark  on  the  front  cover  of  the  new  outpatient 
record  volume  jacket  cover,  in  the  upper  left  corner  or  in  another  area  where  other identifying  record  information  is not obscured, in 2‖ capital letters, with bold, black

  256  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
marker, the appropriate volume number, e.g., ―Volume 2, 3, or 4‖ or ―Volume II, III, or IV,‖ etc. 
5.13.8.2.  Login to CHCS and from the MRT module, verify that the multi-volume record is properly referenced, and if not, create a new electronic volume reference, print a new 
bar-scan ID label and affix to the new record volume jacket in the upper right corner. 5.13.8.3.  Place the new record volume back into main file and relocate older volume(s) 
to  a  designated  location  within  the  secure  records  department.    Label  older  volume(s) with  the same type  of  bold,  black  marker, clearly  indicating  the volume  number  and  be 
sure the bar-scan ID label reflects the older volume number(s). 5.13.9.  Deceased  Patients:    Place  outpatient  records  of  deceased  patients  in  a  separate, 
secured  file  location  within  the  records  department.    Retire  the  non-Active  Duty  medical record  to  the  NPRC  IAW  with  established  record  retirement  procedures.    For  records of 
deceased Active Duty and RCSMs, refer to the Sequestered/Deceased Member‘s Records.  See 5.7.2. 
5.13.10.  Use of AF Form 1942, to manage records is optional.  However, if an MTF Records Custodian  chooses  to  continue  using  the  form,  prepare  and maintain  an  AF  Form  1942  for 
each record permanently forwarded or hand-carried to another facility.  Keep the form in an alphabetical file for 180 days, and then destroy.  See paragraph 5.29. for further information 
regarding permanently transferring medical records to other MTFs. 5.13.11.  Record   custodians   will   comply   with   Air   Force   records   management   and 
maintenance instructions when maintaining Army and Navy records. 5.13.12.  When personnel from the US Army and US Navy are: 
5.13.12.1.  Attached  to  an  Air  Force  facility  for  medical  care,  the  Air  Force  assumes custody  of  their  health  records.    When  patients  from  other  Services  are  treated  in  Air 
Force  facilities  and  require  certain  Service  specific forms  be  completed  and  filed in  the records, the documents will be filed in their record.  The documents will be placed in the 
appropriate section of their outpatient record based on the type of form. 5.13.12.2.  Treated  in  an  MTF  but  their  records  are  not  available,  send  documents, 
routinely  included  in  Air  Force  outpatient  records,  to  the  custodian  of  their  records.    If unknown, forward these documents using guidelines provided in appropriate subsections 
of paragraph 5.19. 5.13.13.  When Air Force personnel are treated at a US Army or US Navy facility; send the 
documentation to the MTF where the record is maintained. 5.13.14.  Interfile Army and Navy records with Air Force records.  Replace folders with the 
AF Form 2100A series only if the color and blocking do not permit interfiling. 5.13.15.  Do  not  use  the  AF  Form  2100A  series  to  document  or  maintain  Mental  Health  or 
Family Advocacy notes, documents, or records.  These files are separated from the outpatient record and are secured in either the Mental Health Clinic or Family Advocacy Office. 
5.14.  Managing Reserve Component Outpatient Records. 
----------------Page (255) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   257  
5.14.1.  Health  records  for  members  of  the  RC  (Category  A)  and  ANG/AGR  are  normally maintained  with  their  respective  medical  units,  unless  a  local agreement  or  MOU  exists 
between the MTF and the RC/ANG unit(s) requires the MTF to maintain them. 5.14.1.1.  The  MTF  may  maintain  health  records  for  members  of  the  RC  (Category  A) 
and ANG who have or are, a) placed on active duty orders for more than 30 days; b) are currently empanelled to an MTF primary care manager; or c) the Service Member or unit 
has provided the MTF records department with the original health record and a copy of the member‘s activation orders.  In these instances, the member is required to notify the 
MTF  records  department  upon  completion  or  removal  from  active  duty  and/or  removal from active MTF enrollment.   If the Service  Member‘s  reserve/ANG unit does not 
provide the outpatient medical records to the MTF during the RCSM‘s period  of  active duty  activation  and/or  empanelment,  the  missing  outpatient  record  will  not  negatively 
count against the MTF‘s paper records availability and accountability percentages. 5.14.2.  Maintain   separate   paper-based   health   records   for   dual or   multiple   healthcare 
eligibility  patients,  (e.g.,  a  patient  who  is  a  family  member  husband  and  a  RCSM).    See Section  4B  and  paragraph  5.10.1.  for  additional  guidance  regarding  dual  or  multiple 
eligibility patient record maintenance.  Medical and dental records for Category B (IMA) and E (PIRR) are maintained at the IMA Service Member‘s servicing USAF MTF usually co-
located at or near the Service Member‘s unit of attachment.  IMA medical and dental records will be maintained IAW the paragraph below. 
5.14.3.  Maintain  health  records  for  individual  mobilization  augmentees  (IMA)  (Cat  B) according to the following instructions: 
5.14.3.1.  Maintain records for centrally managed IMAs (HC, JA, and SG) with the active duty MTF unit of attachment. 
5.14.3.2.  Maintain  records  of  non-centrally  managed  IMAs  with  the  active  duty  MTF unit of assignment. 
5.14.3.3.  Complete an annual inventory of all RC health records on file as of 31 March. 5.14.3.3.1.  RMG/IRMS maintains a registry of IMA/PIRR records/locations, and can 
furnish a list of the records identified in paragraph 5.14.3.1.  Notify HQ AFRC/SGP if records  are  not  located  or  if  a  records  transfer  (due  to  reassignment,  retirement)  is 
required. 5.15.  Geographically Separated Units (GSU) Outpatient Records Management. 
5.15.1.  Active duty service members, and their family members, assigned to a GSU (with no on-site   military   medical   support),   and/or   those   who   reside   more   than   50   miles   or 
approximately  one  hour  of  driving  time  from  the  nearest  MTF  may  be  eligible  for  care through    TRICARE    Prime    Remote    (TPR).        Reference    the    TPR    website    at 
http://www.tricare.osd.mil/tpr. 5.15.2.  The  original  health  records  of  GSU Service  Members  and  their  family  members (if 
family members accompany the sponsor) will NOT be maintained by the sponsor, his or her family  members,  or  provided  to  the  sponsor  or  family  members‘  civilian  PCM  office.  
Instead,  the  records  will  be  maintained  at  the  Air  Force  MTF  nearest  to  where  the  sponsor and/or family members reside. 
----------------Page (256) Break----------------
  258  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.15.3.  Affix the following statement to the outside of each original health record(s) using an address label: ―Assigned to a GSU at or near (Enter City, State, Territory, or Province name 
here).   IAW AFI 41-210, Section 5B, DO NOT RETIRE THIS OUTPATIENT RECORD.‖  See Figure 5.1. GSU Label. 
5.15.4.  Place a copy of the sponsor‘s PCS orders in Section I of the health record on top of most  current  DD  Form  2766.  Place a copy of the sponsor‘s PCS orders in Section I of all 
health records of family  members identified on the PCS order to depart with the sponsor to the GSU.  Active duty personnel and their family members preparing to PCS to a GSU may 
receive a complete copy of their health record from the MTF before the scheduled departure date.  Place the copies in a new AF Form 2100 Series record jacket.  The record jacket of the 
COPY should indicate the record is a copy and identify the MTF where the official record is being maintained.  See Figure 5.2. GSU Record Copy. 
5.15.5.  EXCEPTION  for  Sensitive  Duties  Program  Participants  or  Flight  Status  Personnel:  The original Service Treatment Records (STR) of Service Members assigned to a GSU may 
be  required  to be  maintained  or  stored  at  the  unit  to  maintain  sensitive  duties  program participation, flight status, or individual or overall program certification.  If the original STR 
is required to be kept at the unit, the outpatient medical and dental records will be maintained by  the  unit  commander,  and  secured  in  a  locked  container  behind  at  least  one  locked  door 
during non-duty hours.  Access is restricted to the unit PRP, PSP, of flight status certification or  program  reporting  official.    A  good  example  of  this type  of  scenario  would  apply  to 
Service  Members  assigned  to  remote  Munitions  Sites  (MUNS)  GSUs  in  USAFE.    The nearest Air Force MTF Commander and Service Member‘s GSU commander will ensure 
mechanisms  are  in  place  to  ensure  all  medical  documentation  generated  from  civilian medical facilities are added into the Service Member‘s STR and that all health records are 
maintained IAW this instruction. 5.15.6.  When health record copies are provided, Air Force MTF records personnel will place 
a ―Property of the U.S. Air Force‖ label containing the appropriate MTF address on the record jacket.  See Figure 5.2. GSU Record Copy. 
5.15.7.  Miscellaneous  or  ―loose‖  medical  documents  generated  by  an  MTF  for  GSU members and/or their family members will be forwarded to the MTF or GSU that maintains 
the individual‘s health record. 5.15.8.  Upon  reassignment  from  the  GSU  to  a  military  installation  and  subsequent  MTF 
PCM  assignment,  the  gaining  MTF  will  send  a  DD  Form  877,  Request  for  Medical/Dental Records or Information or DD Form 2138, Request for Transfer of Outpatient Record, so that 
the member‘s original outpatient medical record(s) are forwarded to the new location.  Upon receipt  of  the  original  health  record,  cover  the  GSU  label  with  a  blank  label, create  a  new 
facility location label, and remove the PCS order to the previous GSU location.  The gaining MTF/PCM should complete a release of information authorization for the patient to request 
copies  of  medical  record  documentation  from  their  civilian  provider  to  be  added  into  the official medical record.

 5.16.  Custody and Control of Health Records. 
5.16.1.  Beneficiary  health  records  are  the  property  of  the  United  States  Government.    The information contained in the record belongs to the patient.  IAW the Privacy Act of 1974 and 
HIPAA  of  1996,  the  patient  has  the  right  to  the  information  in  the  record.    However,  the maintenance  of the record  at the MTF  is  a  legal  requirement.    Agency  obligations  mandate 
the  health  records  be  available  for  continuity  of  care  purposes  and  to  support  national accreditation  and  OSD/HA  (TMA)  clinical  coding  auditing  actions.    The  lack  of  medical 
records  and  documentation  may  adversely  impact  individual  patient  medical  continuity  of care as well as AAAHC and/or Joint Commission accreditation.  Generally, beneficiaries are 
----------------Page (258) Break----------------
  260  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
not  authorized  to  hand-carry  their  health  records  IAW  DoDI  6040.43  and  Air  Force  policy identified in this instruction.  Local MTF records management policy must include measures 
to: 5.16.1.1.  Establish  a  methodology  to  obtain  beneficiary  medical  record(s)  upon  arrival 
on-station or upon initial enrollment. 5.16.1.2.  Establish custody of the health record upon the patient‘s initial visit. 
5.16.1.3.  Ensure health records are available so that patients may obtain  a copy of their complete  medical  record.    Refer  to  paragraph  4.7.  for  instructions  on  responding  to 
patient requests for copies of personal health records. 5.16.2.  MTF personnel should not return an original medical or dental record to the patient‘s 
control after an outpatient visit unless authorized to do so by the MTF Commander e.g., the Records Custodian. 
5.16.3.  All miscellaneous, ―loose or late-flowing‖ documents must contain sufficient patient identification information to allow for proper filing IAW paragraph 5.12.  Additionally, these 
documents  must  identify  the  outpatient  records  location  and  the MTF  where  the  record  is maintained. 
5.16.4.  Generally, borrowed records will be returned to the MTF record section by the end of the day.  However, records may be ―charged out‖ or borrowed by an internal MTF requester 
for up to five days if the record is needed to accomplish an official task, audit, review,  etc.  The  borrower  must  provide  his/her  rank  (if  applicable),  first  and  last  name,  office  symbol, 
name of duty or work location, and telephone contact number.  The record must be returned to  the  records  library  as  soon  as  possible.    The  records  department  supervisor  may  grant 
extensions to the 5-day rule on a case-by-case basis.  While in the borrower‘s possession, the record(s)  must  be  secured  and  immediately  produced  upon  request  if  required  for  patient 
care.  When an extension is granted, ―RE-CHARGE‖ the record to the borrower. 5.16.5.  Upon  receipt  of  each  new  outpatient  health  record,  not  already  maintained  in  the 
MTF  records  file  system,  outpatient  records  personnel  will  perform  a  quality  assurance inspection of the medical record.  Inspection checks shall include the following, but are not 
limited   to:   a)   ensure   the   health   record   jacket   is   in   satisfactory   condition   and labeled/documented properly, b) that medical documents are filed in their appropriate place, 
and  c)  remove  any  misfiled  wrong-patient  documents  and  forward  the  documents  to  the appropriate patient record or MTF. 
5.16.6.  As  often  as  necessary,  and  whenever  medical  documents  are  filed  into  a  health record, records personnel will correct any obvious misfiles or other noticeable errors in each 
health record.  MTFs should establish local guidance to best facilitate this process. 5.16.7.  Using  Charge-Out  Guides.    Use  AF  Forms  885,  886,  and  887,  Medical  Record 
Charge-Out  Guides,  and  AF  Form  250,  to  indicate  the  location  of  an  outpatient  record removed  from  the  file.    Use  of  the  MRT  module  in  CHCS  is  required  as  a  tool  to  track 
movement of outpatient records.  It also enhances the management of records accountability and availability. 
5.16.8.  Authorized  Exceptions  that  Allow  Service  Members  to  Hand-Carry  Their  Health Records. 
----------------Page (259) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   261  
5.16.8.1.  Every effort should be made to ensure patients do not leave the MTF with their records  unless  authorized  to  do so.    However,  there  are  at  least  two  significant  reasons 
where MTF records managers are allowed to provide health records to beneficiaries. 5.16.8.1.1.  Exception  #1.    Applies  to  Service  Members  assigned  to  sensitive  duties 
programs,  including  but not  limited  to:  Personnel  Reliability  Program,  Presidential Support  Program,  air  traffic  controllers,  overseas  U.S.  embassy  support,  or  any 
Airmen  assigned  to  a  current  flight  status  (FLY)  position  or  possessing  an  active aeronautical rating.  Service Members who meet the aforementioned requirements or 
Service  Members  who  [will  be]  assigned  to  a  sensitive  duties  or  active  flight  status position  upon  arrival  to  their  next  installation,  are  required  to  hand-carry  their 
outpatient  medical  and  dental  treatment records  (in  a  sealed  envelope  or  package) from  one  MTF  to  another  or  from  one  official  duty  assignment  location  to  another 
during  a  Permanent  Change  of  Station,  re-assignment,  or  extended  Temporary  Duty assignment.  All inbound PRP personnel must hand-carry their medical records.  If a 
TDY Airman is not expected to perform the duties normally associated with his or her sensitive  duties  program  or  aeronautical  mission  or  if  participation  in  said  sensitive 
duties program, flight operations/status, operational program access or permission has been  temporarily  suspended  during  the  TDY  period,  only  the  identified  MTF 
competent  medical  authority,  or  home  station  medical  facility  Chief  of  Aerospace Medicine  may  authorize  the  individual  to  travel  to  the  TDY  location without  his  or 
her outpatient medical or dental treatment records.  See paragraph 5.28. for additional PRP records transfer instructions. 
5.16.8.1.2.  Exception  #2.    The  MTF  Commander  (Custodian  of  Records)  or  his/her delegate is authorized to grant exceptions (in writing) to this policy on a CASE-BY-
CASE  basis  to  satisfy  unique  individual  situations  where  providing  the  original medical and/or dental records to the requesting beneficiary is in the patient‘s and/or 
the government‘s best interest.  MTF  Commanders  may  not  issue  general  blanket orders or MTF policy that allows any beneficiary to hand-carry his or her medical or 
dental  records  without  careful  analysis  of  all  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the individual  request.    Additional  exceptions may  include  circumstances  in  which  a 
significant inconvenience to the patient may occur or where continuity of care may be negatively  impacted  if  records  were  to  be  mailed.    No  sponsor  is  authorized  to 
possess  or  hand-carry  the  original  health  records  or  copies  of  health  records for  any member  of  his  family  aged  18  years  or  older  without  written  permission  from  the 
family member. 5.17.  Filing Outpatient Computer Generated Clinical Diagnostic Results. 
5.17.1.  Daily filing of outpatient clinical diagnostic and/or test results is generally no longer required.  Diagnostic results and tests are easily obtained using available automated computer 
system clinical diagnostic and test results retrieval mechanisms. 5.17.1.1.  If  a  particular state  law  requires  the  maintenance  of  hard  copy  diagnostic  test 
results  or  specifically  prohibits  the storage  of these  results  in  electronic  media,  then the MTF  must  comply.    Otherwise,  there  is  no  requirement  to  print  and  file  (into  the paper 
outpatient medical record) a hardcopy diagnostic or clinical test result, however.

5.17.1.2.  Prior  to  any  PCS  reassignment,  personal  geographic  location  move,  MTF reassignment,  or  change  to  TRICARE  enrollment  location,  MTF  records  personnel  will 
identify  and print  all  CHCS  laboratory,  radiology,  and/or  clinical  diagnostic results  that have accumulated from the departure or losing MTF for each departing beneficiary.  This 
rule applies to Services Members, retirees, and family members alike.  The losing MTF must  still  transfer the paper record  to  the  gaining  MTF.    The  gaining  MTF  will  usually 
not  be  able to  access  or  view  clinical  diagnostic reports  and  information  completed and stored at another MTF or on a CHCS host computer server other than their own.  These 
procedures  are  required  to  ensure  the  gaining  MTF  has  access  to  the  beneficiary‘s complete health record.  While laboratory and radiology reports are usually available in 
AHLTA from  any  MTF  location,  printing  all  available laboratory  and  radiology  reports prior to a beneficiary‘s MTF transfer will alleviate a portion of this burden prior to final 
record disposition. 5.18.  Researching Appropriate Host MTF Record Locations. 
5.18.1.  File  health  record  documents  in  the  appropriate  outpatient  and/or  dental  record  as soon as possible.  Documents received after the record is ―charged out‖ are temporarily 
placed  in  the  pocket  of  the  charge-out  guide  and  will  be  filed  into  the  health  record  upon return to the records library.  The practice of ―blindly‖ mailing medical documents or records 
to the MTF closest to where the beneficiary lives or works is prohibited.  Confirmation of the exact MTF responsible for maintaining the beneficiary‘s health record(s) is required.  If 
confirmation  cannot  be  obtained,  then  contact  the  specific  Uniformed  Service  personnel office according to the instructions in the following sections. 
5.18.2.  Active  Duty  Service  Members:    ADSMs  may  incur  several  permanent  change  of station (PCS) assignments; same station-permanent change of assignment (PCA) relocations; 
temporary  duty  assignments  (TDY),  deployments,  and  personal  Leave  absences  that  may include travel to various locations throughout the United States and abroad.  Along the way, 
MTF medical records personnel may receive medical documents from internal facility clinics for  active  duty  patients  who  have  received  transient  medical  care  during  these  periods.  
Whatever  the  reason,  the  process  of  tracking  down  and  locating  current  duty  assignment stations  is  sometimes  challenging.    Several  options  for  locating  the  primary  record  custody 
locations are listed below. 5.18.2.1.  Active Duty Research Methods: 
5.18.2.1.1.  Locate  a  patient‘s  primary  record  location  by  accessing  the  CHCS-DEERS  eligibility  menu  option  or  by  referencing  the  General  Inquiry  of  DEERS 
(GIQD) Internet website. Defense Medical  Information System (DMIS) ID location, military  installation  name,  and  current  patient  address  are  listed.    Sponsor  SSN  is 
required  to  complete  search.    User ID  and  personal  password  are  required  to  access this  website  application.    Contact  your  Site  Security  Manager  (SSM)  to  obtain 
necessary access.  Contact AFMOA/SGAT if your SSM is not known. 5.18.2.1.2.  Alternate Methods:  When researching Air Force Service Member, access 
the Air Force Portal website‘s ―White Pages‖ locator at https://www.my.af.mil/.  User ID and personal password are required.  Additionally, the Air Force ―Global‖ e-
mail directory may be used as another alternative reference method. 
----------------Page (261) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   263  
5.18.2.1.3.  Although not a medical records or MTF locator, the DefenseLink Internet website  at http://www.defenselink.mil/faq/pis/PC04MLTR.html may  be  of  some 
limited use when researching an individual Service Member‘s duty address or duty contact information. 
5.18.3.  Family  Members,  Retired  Military  Members,  and  Other  Non-Military  Personnel:  Health records of Air Force active duty family members are usually maintained at the MTF 
where the sponsor is assigned unless the sponsor is stationed at a remote or unaccompanied tour  assignment.    File  medical  documents  for  family  members  of  active  duty  or  retired 
military in the medical record at the MTF where the majority of care is provided or where the dependents  are  empanelled  or  enrolled  in  TRICARE.    If  the  medical  document(s)  do  not 
belong at the MTF where the research is accomplished, follow the instructions below. 5.18.3.1.  Research Methods for Family Members, Retired Military Members, and Other 
Non-Military Personnel:  Locate a patient‘s primary record location by accessing the CHCS-DEERS eligibility menu option or by referencing the General Inquiry of DEERS 
(GIQD)  Internet  website.    Defense  Medical  Information  System  (DMIS)  ID  location, military  installation  name,  and  current  patient  address  are  listed.    Sponsor  SSN  is 
required to complete search.  User ID and personal password are required to access this website  application.    Contact  your  Site  Security  Manager  (SSM)  to  obtain  necessary 
access.  Contact AFMOA/SGAT if your SSM is not known. 5.18.3.2.  In  all  other  cases  where  the  record  cannot  be  located  or  if  the  patient‘s 
identification cannot be verified, file the ―loose‖ documents in a charge-out guide.  If the record  is  not  located  within  90-days,  file  the  document(s)  in  either  a  new,  properly 
labeled record jacket, or plain manila folder.  Ensure the manila folder is labeled with the patient‘s full name, family member prefix, sponsor‘s SSN and year of last treatment.  
Create a label with the patient‘s ID and place the label on the left outside flap, in the upper right corner.  Retire these medical documents IAW AFRIMS, Records Disposition 
Schedule, Series 41.  Note:  Card stock medical record jackets are often in short supply.  Whenever  practical  use  plain  manila  folders  to  document  and  store  the  miscellaneous 
―loose‖ documents. 5.18.4.  If patient  cannot  be  properly  identified,  return  document(s) to  the  originating  clinic 
for required ID data completion. 5.18.5.  Develop  local  procedures  between  clinic  and  ancillary  services  personnel  to  correct 
errors and avoid omissions.  Do not ask the patient to return an improperly completed form to the originator. 
5.18.6.  If the referring clinic cannot sufficiently identify the documents for filing, contact the Medical  Records  Review  Committee  chairperson  or  the  Chief  of  the  Medical  Staff  (SGH).  
If, after an extensive review the documents in questions cannot be identified by name, SSN, date of birth, or by any other available means, the Records Review Committee, with approval 
from the SGH, may destroy unidentifiable health documents. 5.19.  Forwarding Loose Leaf, Orphaned, or Miscellaneous Medical Documents. 
5.19.1.  When  forwarding  health  record  documents,  separated  from  the  primary  health record, to another MTF health records department, or similar authorized agency or location, 
follow the instructions listed below:

5.20.  Missing and Lost Health Records. 5.20.1.  Health records, both in electronic and paper form are considered PHI and PII subject 
to the provisions of the Privacy Act (PA).  Once a medical record is deemed ―lost,‖ specific steps must be taken in order to report the information and notify the affected beneficiary or 
party. 5.20.2.  There are several instances when a health record may be considered ―missing.‖  Here 
are some of the most common examples: 5.20.2.1.  A health record may be considered ―missing‖ immediately following a record 
room  supervisor‘s  investigation  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  record‘s disappearance. 
5.20.2.2.  When a health record is discovered missing from the main Record File with no documented borrower location or date. 
5.20.2.3.  When  a  record  is  discovered  missing  from  the  main  Record  File  (with  a documented) borrower location and date, but the physical record has not returned to the 
Main  File  following  a  period  of  30  calendar  days  or  more - without  a  documented explanation. 
5.20.3.  MTFs  must  exhaust  all  reasonable  means  to  locate  a  missing  health  record.    When missing  records  are  discovered,  each  MTF  staff  member  is  responsible  for  searching  their 
immediate work area(s).  MTF personnel will mobilize and help search for a missing record.  The following procedures are required after discovering a record is missing. 
5.20.3.1.  Check  to  identify  possible  borrower  charge-out  locations  in  the  automated MRT  module;  check  for  record  misfiles  in  each  record  storage  room;  search  provider 
offices  and  exam  rooms;  ensure  the  record  has  not  been  forwarded  to  a  peer  review  or clinical   review   committee,   meeting,   or   function;   verify   the   record   has   not   been 
sequestered from main file; verify the record has not been temporarily separated from the main  file  for  any  other  official  review  function;  if  known,  contact  the  previous  MTF 
responsible for maintaining the beneficiary‘s health  records.    If  the  record  still  has  not been  located  following  the  pre-ceding  minimum  search  requirements,  submit  a  record 
search  request  to  the National  Personnel  Records  Center  and  submit  or  add  the missing record to the next quarterly AFMS ―global‖ health records search request list. 
5.20.4.  AFMS ―Global‖ Missing Health Records Search Requests. 5.20.4.1.  If,  after  an  extensive  internal  MTF  search  is  completed,  including  contacting 
the patient‘s previous MTF, the investigation has not yielded the recovery of the missing record(s),  MTF  health  records  officials  may  request  an  Air Force  Medical  Service-wide 
search  for the missing  health  records.    This  AFMOA/SGAT  sponsored  service  provides MTF, RCMU, and GSU health records custodians, with an opportunity to broadcast their 
missing  paper  outpatient  medical  and/or  dental  records  to  other  MTF  records  managers throughout  the  AFMS.    Each  quarter,  AFMOA  officials  solicit  all  MTFs,  RCMUs,  and 
GSUs  to  submit  their  lists  of  missing  medical  and  dental  records  to  the  San  Antonio AFMOA  office  via  secure,  encrypted  e-mail  message.    This  quarterly  missing  record 
―data call‖ includes a pre-formatted data collection spreadsheet that each MTF completes when  documenting  their  missing  record(s).    Before  the missing  record  data/request  is 
----------------Page (266) Break----------------
  268  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
submitted  to  AFMOA,  the  TOPA  flight  commander  or  patient  administration  flight commander  will  verify  that  all  MTF  records  personnel  have  exhausted  every  possible 
research mechanism for every identified missing record.  The TOPA flight commander or the patient administration flight commander will include the following statement in either 
the body of an encrypted e-mail message to AFMOA or typed and included in the faxed report:    ―I  certify  an  extensive  investigation  has  concluded  the  identified  missing 
record(s) cannot be located within this MTF.  All reasonable records research efforts have been  exhausted.    All  necessary  communications  with  records  management  officials  at 
other potential MTF and/or record maintenance and storage sites have not contributed to the successful recovery of the missing record(s).‖ 
5.20.4.2.  The information listed below will be e-mailed or faxed to the AFMOA/SGAT, Health Benefits Office.  Forwarding the missing record information via e-mail message is 
the preferred communication method.  However, fax requests may be accepted but prior coordination  with  AFMOA  is  required.    fax  requests  must  also  include  the  standard 
HIPAA warning advisory.   E-mail messages will ONLY be forwarded to AFMOA using Common  Access  Card  (CAC)  digital  signature  and  encryption  protocols  verified  using 
registered  Air  Force  Public  Key  Infrastructure  (PKI)  identification/security  certificates.  Simply  assigning  a  document  password  and  forwarding  the  information  unencrypted to 
higher  headquarters  is  not  authorized.    The  message  must  be  digitally  signed  and encrypted.  No exceptions.  Include the following information: 
5.20.4.2.1.  Patient‘s Last Name, Patient‘s First Name, Middle Initial. 5.20.4.2.2.  Sponsor‘s Full Name (Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial). 
5.20.4.2.3.  Sponsor‘s SSN. 5.20.4.2.4.  Patient FMP (20, 30, 01, 02, etc.). 
5.20.4.2.5.  Patient‘s PAT CAT. 5.20.4.2.6.  Sponsor‘s Pay Grade and Rank. 
5.20.4.2.7.  Patient Status (AD/AF; Dep Son Ret/USN, Retired USA, etc.). 5.20.4.2.8.  Location  and  date  where  record  was  last  seen.   Note: List  MTF  name 
only.  Due to federal privacy laws, specific references to the name of the last known outpatient clinic or clinical work center will not be forwarded to the AFMS, e.g., do 
not include the Urology Clinic, 19 Sep 2010 as the last known record location. 5.20.4.2.9.  Identify  a  POC  for  each  missing  record.    Include  name,  rank,  telephone 
number, and e-mail address. 5.20.5.  If after all preceding research actions have completed, and still the missing record(s) 
has not been recovered, the squadron commander responsible for the records room reporting the loss is responsible for informing the MTF Commander.  Only the MTF Commander may 
deem a missing health record as ―lost.‖ 5.20.5.1.  After all efforts to find the lost health record(s) are exhausted, MTF personnel 
must  follow  the  guidelines  and  procedures  identified  in  DoD  5400.11-R  in  consultation with the installation Public Affairs Officer and available installation legal staff and/or the 
MLC.    MTF  personnel  should  be  aware  that  Public  Affairs  reporting  and  notification 
----------------Page (267) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   269  
procedures often require disclosing the paper or  electronic breech to the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team (USCERT) within one hour of the ―lost‖ determination. 
5.21.  Health Records Availability, Accountability, and ―Tracking‖ Standards. 5.21.1.  All  MTFs  and/or  medical  units  with  CHCS  computer  capabilities  must  utilize  the 
CHCS MRT function to properly manage, track, and locate health records.  Efficient use of associated MRT system tools like the records bar code scanner and electronic AF Form 250, 
Health Record Charge-Out Guide Request will save time and reduce misplaced paper health records.    Any  non-MTF  organization  authorized  to  maintain  ADSM  or  RC  health  records 
without  using  the  CHCS  computer  MRT  module  to  identify  and  manage  their  record inventory, shall establish a manual tracking system. 
5.21.2.  The CHCS computer MRT function will be used to ―charge in‖ and ―charge out‖ records between the medical records department and every authorized requesting ―borrower‖ 
location in the MTF or within the medical unit.  Records managers should create or ―build‖ borrowing  locations  within  the  MRT  module  for  all  locations/borrowers  that  regularly 
request health records.  Contact your site CHCS systems office for assistance. 5.21.3.  Monthly Outpatient Medical Record Accountability Review:  Every 30 days, records 
managers  in  each  MTF  record  room  will  review  all  of  the  medical  records  that  have  been loaned or ―charged out‖ to borrowers for more than 30 days.  Records personnel are required 
to  identify  each  overdue  record  and  contact  the  last  known  borrower  to  inquire  about  the status  of  the  record.    Establish  a  local  process  to  retrieve  records  that  have  been  loaned  to 
borrowers for more than 30 days.  Overdue records will be identified by viewing the CHCS Overdue  Records  List  Report  or  similar  CHCS records  management  reporting  mechanism.  
Maintain  monthly  overdue/missing  record  statistics  by  documenting  the  overall  records assigned  to  the  individual  record  room  (denominator)  and  comparing  this  number  to  the 
number  of  overall  missing  and/or  overdue  medical  records  (numerator).    To  obtain  the percentage  of  missing  and/or  overdue  records,  divide  the  numerator  by  the  denominator.  
Report findings monthly to the Health Records Review Committee (or similar records review function),  and  to  the  TOPA  Flight  Commander  or  Patient  Administration  Officer.    The 
TOPA  function  is  responsible  for  creating  an  aggregate  MTF  total  of  overdue  or  missing records.    The  TOPA  Flight  Commander  or  Patient  Administration  Officer  will  use  the 
submitted  information  to  identify  duty locations  and/or  individuals  who  routinely  borrow records  without  returning  them  to  the  main  file.    Refer  to  paragraph  5.14.  for  potential 
medical records availability exceptions for RCSMs on active duty orders.  Refer to paragraph 5.20., Lost Medical Records, for additional information regarding obligations required when 
reporting missing or lost medical records. 5.21.4.  Health  Record   Availability  Standards:    With  the  implementation  of  the  DoD 
electronic  health  record,  immediate  reliance  upon  outpatient  paper  medical  records  should diminish, not cease.  Eventually, the AFMS will completely transition from a paper-based to 
a  comprehensive,  all-inclusive,  electronic  health  record  system.    However,  to  satisfy  DoD, Joint Commission, and AAAHC functional and provider/point-of-service outpatient medical 
record availability, and various auditing requirements, paper outpatient paper medical records must  still  be  maintained  and  accounted  for  at  each  MTF.    Two  basic  medical  records 
availability metrics measure an MTF‘s compliance with standards. 
----------------Page (268) Break----------------
  270  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.21.4.1.  AFMS  Provider/Point  of  Service  Record  Availability  Standard.    Unless  an MTF has implemented  a local policy to retrieve or ―pull‖ outpatient paper medical 
records  by  exception,  MTFs  will  continue  to implement  a  system  to  meet  the minimum 90% Air Force  Medical  Service  (AFMS) provider/point-of-service  availability  standard. 
Air  Force  Medical  Service  Provider/Point  of  Service  availability  is  defined  as  the physical presence of the paper record for use at the point-of-service or when needed for 
specific  review  or  audit.    This  standard  applies  to  MTF  records  rooms  (whether centralized or decentralized). 
5.21.4.1.1.  Methodology.    Outpatient  records  availability  percentages  are  generated by tracking and maintaining the numbers of records that were retrieved and delivered 
to the point-of-service, then dividing by the number of record requests (manual entry AF  Form  250  and  electronic  record  requests)  received.    The  overall  monthly  MTF 
records  availability  percentage  is  generated  by  combining  the  monthly  number  of records  delivered  to  the  point-of-service  (for  each  individual  records  room)  then 
dividing  this  total  number  by  the  total  number  of  all  MTF  outpatient  record  room requests  (manual  and  electronic).    Report  this  data  to  the  MTF  Health  Records 
Review Committee or function and to the AFMOA/SGAT Health Benefits office by the 10th duty day following the close of the previous reporting month.  For patients 
with multiple appointments on the same day, count the record as being available for all  of  the  appointments  as  long  as  the  record(s)  was  delivered  to  the  first  scheduled 
appointment.    However,  records  personnel  should  attach  a  note  or  locally  created notice or ―flag‖ to the record, before distribution to  the  first  appointment  location.  
The note should inform the record(s) borrower that the patient has multiple same-day appointments.  The note or ―flag‖ will alert clinic staff to forward the patient‘s record 
to  the  next  clinic.    Clinic  personnel  are  required  to  forward  the  record  to  the  next location. 
5.21.4.2.  DoD Minimum Functional Control Record Availability Standard.  MTF records managers  must  ensure  their  outpatient  records  control  process  include  procedures  to 
ensure  95%  percent  availability  of  all  outpatient  medical  records.    "Availability"  is defined  as  any  outpatient  medical  record  located  within  the  MTF  having  functional 
responsibility  for maintaining the record.  DoD  "availability" is not to be confused with "provider or point of service‖ availability as described in the previous paragraph. 
5.21.4.2.1.  Methodology.    DoDI  6040.40,  Military  Health  System  Data  Quality Management Control Procedures, Enclosure 1, paragraph C.6., identifies a minimum 
―on hand‖ records availability audit  formula.    From  a  random  sample  of  CHCS outpatient  appointments  from  the  reporting  month,  medical  record  personnel  will 
determine the percentage of available or ―on hand‖ outpatient paper medical records that can be physically located in a record room file system.  If an outpatient record is 
not   immediately   physically   available   in   the   record   room   file,   but   a   properly documented AF Form 250 and plastic record charge-out guide are filed in place of the 
paper  record,  then  count  the  record  as  available.    If an  MTF  can  prove  record availability, according to this standard, by ―pinpointing‖ the specific location of the 
record  within  an  MTF  medical  records  department(s)  or  MTF  borrower  location, using  the  CHCS  computer  MRT  module  or  from  a  properly  documented  AF Form 
250, then count the record as available.  Records loaned to a borrower with a ―check-
----------------Page (269) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   271  
out‖  date  older  than  30  days,  must  be  physically  located  and  verified  with  the borrower. 
5.21.4.3.  Report  monthly  AFMS  availability  and  OASD  Health  Affairs availability percentages to the MTF Health Records Review Committee.  The committee chairperson 
will  then  report  this  information  monthly  to  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Medical Staff (ECOMS) unless otherwise directed by the MTF Commander. 
5.21.4.4.  Refer  to  paragraph  5.14.  for  potential  records  availability  exceptions  for RCSMs placed on active duty. 
5.21.5.  Converting to a Paper Medical Records Retrieval or ―Pull‖ by Exception Process:  The  Health  Records  Review  Committee  and  the  Executive  Committee  must  support  any 
decision to suspend or discontinue retrieving or ―pulling‖ outpatient medical records for daily outpatient appointments. 
5.21.5.1.  The  MTF  SGH,  in  coordination  with  the  unit  commander(s)  responsible  for health   records   maintenance   and   management,   must   determine,   based   on   program 
management  analysis  and  input  from  the  entire  clinical  staff  that  all  providers  who  use AHLTA, are using the system the way it was designed to be used. 
5.21.5.2.  If the SGH  and  respective  unit  commander(s) support  the decision  to  suspend daily  paper  outpatient  medical  records  retrieval  and  distribution,  the  MTF  Commander 
may  approve  the  decision  or  determine  another  course  of  action.    Approval  may  be  for defined  specialty  groups,  FHEs, clinics  and/or  entire  facilities.    Documentation  of 
approval  must  include  any  sub-groups  that  will  continue  to  require  paper  records  on  a regular basis. 
5.21.5.3.  Prior to approving any retrieve or ―pull‖ records by exception policy, the MTF Commander  must  ensure  that  the  requesting  clinical  work  center(s)  have  created  a 
process  to  verify  patients  have  signed  the  HIPAA  Notice  of  Privacy  Practices  for  each empanelled  patient.    Refer  to  Section  6C  for  specific  information  and  expectations 
regarding HIPAA (NoPP) requirements. 5.21.5.4.  If  the  MTF  Commander  decides  to  suspend  traditional  daily  paper  outpatient 
medical records retrieval and distribution processes, an immediate six-month trial phase will  be  begin  starting  from  the  date  of  the  decision  or  other  designated  implementation 
date. 5.21.5.5.  During this period, the AFMS Provider or Point of Service records availability 
percentage,  for patients  with a) an  established electronic medical  record  history, b) new patients  with  no  previous  outpatient  paper medical  record,  and  c) patient  encounters  for 
which  the  provider  does  not  need  to  reference  the  traditional  paper  outpatient  medical record,  will be deemed to be 100%.  Records room managers will meet  with the CHCS 
site  manager  and/or  information  systems  managers  to  suspend  the  automated  function that produces the pre-printed AF Form 250, prior to each patient‘s appointment.  Records 
personnel will inform clinic staff that individual records requests are still possible using CHCS. 
5.21.5.6.  During  this  period,  if  a  provider(s)  requests  the  traditional  paper  outpatient medical  record  prior  to  a  patient  encounter,  and  assuming  there  is  an  established 
----------------Page (270) Break----------------
  272  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
traditional  paper  record  on  file,  records  room  personnel  will  retrieve  and  distribute  the requested  record(s).    For  all  requested  traditional  outpatient  paper  medical  records 
requested  separately  from  the  AHLTA  system,  records  room  supervisors  will  apply  the same  record  availability  methodology  previously  referenced  in  paragraph  5.21.5.1.,  and 
report this records availability statistic monthly to the Health Records Review Committee and to AFMOA/SGAT. 
5.21.5.7.  At the end of the six-month outpatient paper record suspension trial phase, the SGH, in coordination with the unit commander responsible for traditional health records 
maintenance and management, and based in part upon the input received from the Health Records Review Committee, the ECOMS, and input from the provider staff, will make a 
recommendation   to   the   MTF   Commander for   one   of   the   following   options,   a) permanently  or  temporarily  cease  MTF  daily  outpatient  paper  medical  records  retrieval 
and distribution processes, b) implement a limited cessation or selective cessation (based on  MTF-unique  circumstances)  of  paper  medical  records  retrieval  and  distribution,  c) 
institute   another   trial   period,   or   d)   determine   some   other   appropriate   action.  Additionally,  whatever  process  is  chosen,  paper  documents  from  internal  and  external 
sources,  scanned  and  uploaded  into  the  EHR,  must  continue  to  be  filed  into  the  paper health record. 
5.21.5.7.1.  Exception 1:  Until further policy  guidance is provided, paper outpatient medical records will continue to be  retrieved  from the appropriate records file room 
and distributed to providers for daily outpatient encounters  for members assigned to flight status or participating in the PRP, PSP, or other sensitive duties program.  See 
paragraph  5.28.  for  more  information  regarding  members  assigned  to  the  PRP  or similar sensitive duties programs. 
5.21.5.7.2.  Exception 2: For  official  auditing  purposes,  the  auditor  must  either  be supplied with a paper copy of the applicable patient encounters or provided access to 
AHLTA to review the outpatient encounter documentation. 5.21.6.  Using  Charge-Out  Guides.    Use  AF  Forms  885,  886,  and  887.    Medical  Record 
Charge-Out  Guides,  and  AF  Form  250,  to  indicate  the  location  of  an  outpatient  record removed  from  the  file.    Use  of  the  MRT  module  in  CHCS  is  required  as  a  tool  to  track 
movement of outpatient records.  It also enhances the management of records accountability and availability. 
5.21.7.  Loaning   Records   to   Clinics/Units.      MTFs   must   establish   strict,   but   sensible, procedures to manage the loaning of records.  The following instructions must be adhered to 
ensure sound health records management operations. 5.21.7.1.  Limit   access   to   all   outpatient   medical   records   areas   to   only   authorized 
personnel.  MTF personnel should not be granted access based solely on the proximity of their clinic or work center to the secure records area. 
5.21.7.2.  When  a  paper  medical  record  is  requested  or  removed  from  file  by  an authorized borrower, records room personnel will ensure the borrower uses a charge-out 
guide and completes the AF Form 250 with accurate, adequate, and legible, information or requests the record through the CHCS MRT module.  Whenever possible, automated 
CHCS AF Form 250s should be used to place inside the charge-out guide. 
----------------Page (271) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   273  
5.21.7.3.  The   outpatient   records   department   and   clinic   personnel   will   ensure   the outpatient record is available prior to the patient‘s appointment. 
5.21.7.4.  Medical  records  staff  must  notify  the  requesting  clinic or  clinical  work  center when  the  medical  record  is  not  available.    If  the  record  is  not  available  at  the  clinic  or 
borrower‘s location before the patient arrives the clinic staff should access the MRT module  to  ascertain  the  location  of  the  health  record(s)  or  contact  the  medical  records 
department  if  an  explanation  has  not  been  provided.    If  the  record  is  not  available,  the provider should make an entry on the form used to document care that the record was not 
available for review. 5.21.7.5.  Generally,  health  records  are  only  to  be  loaned  to  internal  work  centers.  
However, there may be very unique instances when the original health record(s) may be released  to  an  outside  agency,  MTF,  civilian  medical  facility,  or  even  the  patient.    The 
MTF  Commander  is  the  only  official  authorized  to  release  original  health  record(s)  to external  MTF  requestors.   Note: If a  health  record(s) is  involved  in  a  potential  Medical 
Affirmative  (MAC)  Claim,  or  other  potential  claim  either  for  or   against  the  US Government,  or  for  potential  litigation,  or  for  use  as  evidence  in  a  court of  law,  do  not 
give the original record to the patient.  All parties with legitimate and legal authorization to receive either the health record(s) or copies will be provided the information once all 
security  validation  and/or  authorization  requirements  have  been  met.    Refer  to  the HIPAA disclosure and information release section of this instruction for further guidance. 
5.21.7.5.1.  The   Medical   Cost   Reimbursement   Program   (MCRP)   replaced   the Hospital  Recovery  (HR)  claims  program  administered  by  base  legal  offices  and  is 
now administered through 8 regional offices.  MCRP recoveries are made pursuant to the Federal  Medical  Care  Recovery  Act  and  the  Coordination  of  Benefits  statute,  as 
well as any applicable state laws allowing for recovery. All money recovered will be returned  to  the  MTFs  or  TMA. MCRP  legal  personnel  may  require  access  to  health 
records   and   MTFs   should   coordinate   the   appropriate   access   to   needed   health information. For more information on MCRP, contact the Air Force Legal Operations 
Agency, Claims and Tort Litigation Division (AFLOA/JACC). 5.21.7.6.  Health records for military retired Service Members and the records of a retired 
Service Member‘s family members must be maintained at an MTF. 5.21.8.  Medical Records Custody Responsibility and Records Borrower Training. 
5.21.8.1.  TRICARE  Operations  and/or  Patient  Administration  officials  will  brief  newly assigned staff members during initial ―in-processing‖ or MTF newcomer‘s orientation 
and  again  annually  thereafter,  about  their  responsibilities  regarding  expected  health records  custody  management.  Training  should  provide,  but  not  be  limited  to,  how  to 
request  a  paper  medical  record,  information  regarding  appropriate  records  control, release, availability, accountability of health records, and the transition from paper-based 
to electronic health records. Training may be informal, formal, or computer-based.  This records  ―awareness‖  training  is  separate  from  initial  and  annual  HIPAA  training 
requirements. 5.21.8.2.  Training  will  be  documented  in  the Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan 
or other official record of personnel training accomplishments. 
----------------Page (272) Break----------------
  274  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.21.8.3.  Just as important as the availability of health records so is the completeness of the  documentation  for  the  same.  MTFs  will  establish  procedures  to  ensure  that  records 
contain accurate and complete documentation of outpatient visits. 5.21.8.4.  MTFs  should  inform  beneficiaries  of  DoD  and  AFMS  health  records  custody 
rules   whenever   and   wherever   possible   (e.g.,   at   town   hall   meetings,   via   patient newsletters, time of MTF registration, etc). 
5.21.9.  Obtaining Government Owned Medical Record(s) from Patients:  When it is known that a patient has custody of their record(s), initiate the following procedures to retrieve the 
record from the patient: 5.21.9.1.  Contact  the patient  and/or  the sponsor  and  inform  the party(s) the  record(s) is 
the property of the United States Government and must be returned immediately.  Inform the patient they may receive a free copy of the record but the original must be maintained 
at the MTF. 5.21.9.2.  If the patient does not return the record after contact, take the following actions: 
5.21.9.2.1.  Active  Duty  and  their  Family  Members:    Contact  the  sponsor‘s  first sergeant or unit commander for assistance in retrieving the health record(s).   Inform 
the sponsor‘s unit commander or first sergeant of your previous attempts to collect the record(s) in accordance with instruction.   If, after contacting the sponsor‘s chain 
of command, the patient still has not returned the record(s), send a certified letter to the sponsor‘s and/or patient‘s home address notifying him/her that the record(s) are 
the  property  of  the  United  States  Government.   Inform  the  sponsor  or  patient  that  a complete  copy  may  be  provided  at  no  charge.    The  sponsor  must  provide  a  signed 
authorization  however for any  dependent  over the  age  of  18.    Reference  any  known previous attempts or actions to collect the record(s) and instances (if any) of refusals 
to cooperate.  Request the record(s) be returned to the MTF within 10 calendar days from receipt of the letter.  Inform the sponsor that failure to comply will result in an 
additional notification to his/her first sergeant or unit commander which may result in potential administrative or corrective personnel action. 
5.21.9.2.2.  For all other beneficiaries enrolled to your MTF:  If, after requesting the record(s) in accordance with the directions found in this instruction, the patient(s) still 
has not returned the record(s), send a certified letter to the sponsor‘s and/or patient‘s home  address  notifying  him/her  that  the  record(s)  are  the  property  of  the  United 
States  Government.    Inform  the  sponsor  or  patient,  that  a  complete  copy  may  be provided (at no charge) to the sponsor and/or patient.  Reference any known previous 
attempts  or  actions  to  collect  the  record(s)  and  instances  (if  any)  of  refusals  to cooperate.    Request  the  record(s)  be  returned  to  the  MTF  within  10  calendar  days 
from  receipt  of  the  letter.    Inform  the  patient  and/or  sponsor  that  failure  to  comply will  result  in  notification  to  local  law  enforcement  or  installation  Security  Forces 
which  may  result  in  a  criminal  investigation  for  theft  of  United  States  Government property. 
5.21.10.  Clinic Personnel Record Accountability and Tracking Responsibilities: 5.21.10.1.  Clinic  personnel  must  keep  outpatient  record  entries  up-to-date  and  use  the 
following disposition rules: 
----------------Page (273) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   275  
5.21.10.1.1.  As  a  general  rule,  records  are  to  be  returned  to  the  Outpatient  Records location  at  the  end  of  the  duty  day  associated  with  each  episode  of  care.    Any 
provider  requiring   extended  use  of   a  record   to  complete  necessary   healthcare documentation  requirements  should  re-charge  the  health  record  to  their  clinic  every 
three-days using the CHCS Medical Records Tracking module. 5.21.10.1.2.  Admission  to  Hospital.    Send  the  outpatient  record  to  the  designated 
inpatient  nursing  unit.    Clinic  personnel  will  update  the  CHCS  MRT  module  to document that the record has been transferred to the appropriate inpatient nursing unit 
5.21.10.1.3.  Transfer   of   Patient   to   Another   Military   Facility   for   Treatment.  Outpatient  medical  records  may  be  transferred  to  another  MTF  without  obtaining  a 
patient‘s permission.  MTF personnel are required to document the record transfer using the CHCS MRT module. 
5.22.  Medical Documentation Requirements for Partial Hospitalization. 5.22.1.  Partial  hospitalization is  defined  as  a  facility  or  unit  that  provides  a  planned 
therapeutic  program  for  patients  who do  not  require  full  time hospitalization,  but  who need broader  programs  than  are  possible  from  outpatient  visits  in  a  hospital-based  or  hospital-
affiliated  facility.    Patients  would  spend  a  portion  or  majority  of  a  day  (less  than  24-hour daily  care) in  a  hospital  setting  and  then return  to  their homes  or  places  of  residence  in  the 
evening.  They would then return to the facility on the following day. 5.22.1.1.  Partial   hospitalizations   are   characterized   by   structured,   daily   supervised, 
outpatient  activities  over  a  prolonged  period  (usually  2-6  weeks)  tailored  to  treat  or rehabilitate   individuals   with   generic-like   illnesses,   dependencies   or   psychological 
profiles.  Partial hospitalization may be used for crisis stabilization, treatment of partially stabilized  mental  health  disorders  for  adults  and  adolescents,  chemical  dependency 
treatment  programs,  or  as  a  transition  from  an  inpatient  program  when  medically necessary. 
5.22.1.2.  All  documentation  for  partial  hospitalization  must  comply  with  the  current Joint  Commission  documentation  standards.    Standard  Forms  (SF),  or  other  forms,  as 
noted, are recommended for use in the partial hospitalization records.  At a minimum, the documentation in the medical record will include: 
5.22.1.2.1.  SF 504, Parts I and II. 5.22.1.2.2.  SF 505, Parts II and III. 
5.22.1.2.3.  SF 506 . 5.22.1.2.4.  Nursing assessments and interventions. 
5.22.1.2.5.  SF  509,  written  daily,  which  reflects  a  brief  summary  of  the  therapeutic activity,  observation  of  the  patient‘s  status  and  responses  in  the  course  of  the 
therapeutic contact and the therapist‘s plans for any subsequent therapeutic contact. 5.22.1.2.6.  AF Form 3066 or 3066-1. 
5.22.1.2.7.  AF Form 3069, as applicable. 
----------------Page (274) Break----------------
  276  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.22.1.2.8.  Supporting  documentation  such  as  case  management  notes,  treatment team   notes,   weekly   progress   summaries,   and   physician   summaries   including 
physician supervision, evaluation, and certification. 5.22.1.2.9.  Patient education, release instructions, and plans for follow-up care. 
5.22.1.3.  All  documentation  related  to  a  partial  hospitalization  stay  will  be  filed  as  a package in the mental health record  IAW AFI 44-172 or in Section III of the outpatient 
medical  record,  as  applicable.    Illnesses  related  to  mental  health  will  be  filed  in  the mental health record. 
5.23.  Supplemental Documentation Guidance. 5.23.1.  Inpatients   Seen   in   Outpatient   Clinics.      Occasionally,   inpatients   may   have 
appointments  in  an  outpatient  clinic  during  their  admission.    After  the  appointment,  the outpatient clinic staff will forward the outpatient appointment document(s) to the inpatient‘s 
nursing unit or place into the inpatient medical record. 5.23.2.  Withdrawing  Documents.    When  documents  in  an  outpatient  record  are  relevant  to 
further  treatment  as  an  inpatient,  the  documents  may  be  withdrawn  and  inserted  in  the inpatient record.  Note the withdrawal on SF 600.  Other than this exception, original medical 
document(s) will not be removed from a medical record after filing. 5.23.3.  Dead  on  Arrival  (DOA)  and  Emergency  Room  Death  (ERD).    All  MTF  DOA  and 
ERD encounters will be reported in the automated ambulatory data collection system or other ambulatory data collection and coding system.  Appropriate clinical coding and MEPRS code 
assignment  is  required.    Any  documents  created  for  these  patients  will  be  filed  in  an Extended  Ambulatory  Record  (EAR)  and  maintained  in  a  secure,  limited  access  area, 
separate from inpatient/outpatient health records. 5.23.4.  Variations in the disposition and maintenance of records in clinics are not authorized.  
The MTF Commander ensures that the health records are maintained as required by current Air Force directives. 
5.23.5.  Request  for  Ancillary  Services.    Clinic  personnel  will  ensure  the  appropriate ancillary request form is properly completed and lists all patient identification and other data 
required  by  directives.    Develop  local  procedures  between  clinic  and  ancillary  services  to correct errors and avoid omissions. 
5.23.6.  When health record documents are received without adequate identification, records personnel  may  return  the  documents  to  the  point  of  origin.    The  originating  clinical  work 
center  must  add  the  missing  information  for  each  incomplete  entry  and  then  return  the document(s) to the appropriate health record section. 
5.24.  Mental Health Records Documentation Requirements. 5.24.1.  Mental  health  records  are  a  separate  category  of  records  that  contain  detailed 
psychiatric  notations  of  evaluations,  consultations,  tests,  and  treatment  provided  on  an outpatient or inpatient status.  Do not use AF Form 2100 or 2100A series for records kept in 
the mental health clinic.  These records must be kept in properly secured files in the mental health  clinic.    See  AFI  44-109  and  AFI  44-172,  Chapter  4,  for  details  on  mental  health 
records and records management.

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   277  
5.25.  Prenatal Records Documentation Requirements. 5.25.1.  Prenatal  records  may  be  maintained  separately  by  the prenatal  clinic and  then must 
be  incorporated,  as  a  package,  into  the  inpatient  record  at  the  time  of  delivery,  see Attachment 16  for filing instructions.  For exceptions, see the following: 
5.25.1.1.  If a patient is transferred or relocates before delivery, the prenatal record should be given to the patient to hand-carry to the next MTF.   If the patient does not expect to 
deliver  in  an  MTF,  copies  of  the  prenatal  record  should  be  given  to  the  patient  and  the original documents filed in the patient‘s outpatient record. 
5.25.1.2.  Prenatal  records  should  be  screened  quarterly.    When  the  expected  date  of delivery  has  passed  or  there  is  no  indication  that  the  patient  is  being  followed,  the 
prenatal  record  should  be  withdrawn  from  the  prenatal  file  and  forwarded  to  the outpatient records department for inclusion in the patient‘s outpatient record.  If no 
outpatient record is available, prepare one. 5.26.  Family Advocacy Program (FAP) Documentation Requirements. 
5.26.1.  The Family Advocacy clinic or office maintains the original FAP patient record.  The FAP  record  contains  detailed,  confidential  information  regarding  alleged  or  verified  family 
maltreatment.    For  every  patient  visit  to  the  Family  Advocacy  clinic,  an  abbreviated continuity  of  care  entry  must  be  documented  in  AHLTA.    Treatment  entries,  documenting 
only  minimal  information,  are  inserted  into  AHLTA  by  FAP  providers.    The  continuity  of care AHLTA entry most commonly used indicates: ―Patient was seen in Family Advocacy 
for assessment due to allegations of family maltreatment.‖  Other abbreviated or minimally documented   statements  or  references  to  one‘s  suicidal/homicidal  assessment  and/or  a 
maltreatment  risk  assessment  will  also  be  included  in  an  AHLTA  entry.    The  initial  FAP Clinical  Case  Staffing  (CCS)  recommendations  will  be  placed  in  AHLTA,  as  well  as  the 
transfer/closure summary for each patient treated in FAP. 5.26.2.  When  patients  are  seen  in  FAP  for  prevention  services,  there  is  only  a  requirement 
for  an  AHLTA  note  when  there  is  a  clinically  significant  finding,  requiring  documentation for continuity of care or a referral to a medical provider. 
5.27.  Documentation  Requirements  to  Support  Graduate  Medical  Examination  (GME) Programs.  Documentation  requirements  will  be  as  outlined  by  the  Accreditation  Council  for 
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in their common and specific program requirements. 5.28.  Managing  Service  Treatment  Records  (STR)  for  Service  Members  Assigned  to  the 
Personnel  Reliability  Program  (PRP),  Sensitive  Duties  Programs,  and  for  Personnel Assigned to Flight Status. 
5.28.1.  Medical  Notification  Process:  The  Service  Treatment  Record  (medical  and  dental records)  for  Service  Members  assigned  to  the  PRP,  Presidential  Support  Program,  active 
flying programs/status, or other highly sensitive, national security operations, require special handling to maintain program reliability and integrity. Overall PRP program requirements are 
located in DoD 5210.42-R, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program, June 30, 2006  and AFMAN 10-3902, same title. MTF records managers are required to print the Electronic 
Health  Record  (EHR)  patient  encounter  document(s)  for  every  episode  of  care  for  each Service Member assigned to a sensitive duties (e.g., PRP, PSP, etc...) position. EHR patient 
----------------Page (276) Break----------------
  278  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
encounters must be printed to document each individual‘s operational status, unit notification stamp,  notifier‘s  name/initials,  and  time  and  date  of  the  notification.  File  the  printed 
encounters  in  the  Service  Member‘s  outpatient  medical  record.  Until  further  policy instructions are released, and/or the Military Health System (MHS) EHR system is enhanced 
to   support   automated   individual   operational   capability/status   notifications   for   Service Members assigned to any sensitive duties program or Airmen assigned to active flight status, 
the  use  of  the  EHR  alone  is  not  enough  to  ensure  program  assurance  for  these  unique mission-critical programs.  Printing of every encounter is not required for Service Members 
on FLY status who are not also on a sensitive duty status.  Aeromedical dispositions on FLY status  may be  performed  electronically,  with  unit  notifications  for  changes  in  status  being 
managed via the PIMR program. 5.28.2.  Transferring STRs During PCS, PCA, or Permanent Duty Location Reassignment for 
Service Members Assigned to a Sensitive Duties Program or Flight Status. 5.28.2.1.  This  section  applies  to  any  Service  Member  or  Airman  currently  assigned  or 
who will be assigned upon arrival at their next installation or organization, to a sensitive duties  or  active  flight  status  position,  including  but  not  limited to: Personnel  Reliability 
Program,  Presidential  Support  Program,  air  traffic  controllers,  overseas  U.S.  embassy support, or any Airmen on active Flight Status (FLY) or a Service Member assigned to a 
Flight position or those who maintain an active aeronautical rating. Airmen meeting these requirements,  or  any  other  Service  Member  authorized  by  the  MTF  Commander,  are 
required to hand-carry their outpatient medical and dental treatment records (in a sealed envelope  or  package)  from  the  losing  or  departure  MTF  to  the  arrival  or  gaining  MTF; 
from the departure RCMU to the arrival or gaining RCMU; or from any official location responsible  for  maintaining  health  records  to  the  arrival  or  gaining  MTF,  RCMU,  or 
official  duty  assignment  during  a Permanent  Change  of  Station,  Permanent  Change  of Assignment, duty location re-assignment or extended Temporary Duty (TDY) assignment 
(excluding deployment).  Inbound PRP and active flight crew personnel must hand-carry their  medical  records.    If  an  Airman is  not  expected  to  perform  the  duties  normally 
associated  with  his  or  her  sensitive  duties  program,  flight,  or  aeronautical  mission  or position,  or  if  sensitive  duties  program,  flight  status,  operational  program  access  or 
permission(s)  has  been  suspended or  is  expected  to  be  suspended  during,  or  at  the  next installation  or  duty  assignment,  or  during  an  extended  TDY  period,  only  the  identified 
MTF  Competent  Medical  Authority,  or  MTF  Chief  of  Aerospace  Medicine  (SGP)  may authorize an individual to travel to the gaining installation or TDY location without his or 
her outpatient medical and dental treatment records in hand. 5.28.3.  Physical  Separation,  from  the  Main  File,  for  STRs  of  Service  Members  on  Active 
Flight Status or Those Service Members Assigned to a Sensitive Duties Program. Outpatient medical  and  dental  treatment  records  for  active  flight  personnel  or  Airmen  assigned  to  the 
PRP,  PSP,  or  any  other  sensitive  duty  program,  shall  be  maintained  in  a  separate,  secured location.  Access  to  these  physical  STRs  must  be  restricted  to  only  those  medical  personnel 
with an official need. 5.28.4.  Airmen  meeting  the  personnel  status  conditions  identified  above  are  required  to 
hand-carry  their  health  treatment  records  (in  a  sealed  envelope)  from  the losing  MTF  or RCMU to the gaining MTF or to the medical unit responsible for maintaining health records. 
Upon  arrival  to  the  gaining  MTF  or  to  the  medical  unit,  the  health  records  must  be 
----------------Page (277) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   279  
surrendered to the MTF clinic or office responsible for the daily maintenance of these special records. 
5.28.5.  Before  health  records  are  provided to  the  Service  Member, outpatient  and/or  dental records medical and dental record personnel will seal the record(s) in an appropriately sized 
envelope, then write or place a pre-worded ink stamp that indicates, ―During Transport, Open Only for Medical Emergencies,‖ across the envelope sealed flap seam. Then place one strip 
of clear or transparent ½ inch adhesive tape down the entire length of the envelope along the sealed flap seam. Finally, the records management official that seals the envelope must write 
his/her initials along the sealed flap seam and legibly write or place a pre-worded ink stamp that  identifies  the  losing  MTF  or  installation  DTF  unit  name,  office  symbol,  address, 
installation name, zip code, POC name and contact telephone number. 5.29.  Transferring Health Records Between MTFs or Medical Units. 
5.29.1.  Transferring STRs During PCS, PCA or Permanent Duty Location Reassignment for Airmen Not Assigned to Sensitive Duties or Active Flight Status. 
5.29.1.1.  Custody and Control of Outpatient Medical and Dental Records:  Historically, Airmen have been allowed to hand-carry their outpatient medical and dental records in a 
sealed envelope during a PCS or PCA reassignment.  This practice is now prohibited for all  Airmen,  with  the  exception  of  Airmen  assigned,  or  who  will  likely  be  assigned,  to 
active  Flight  status,  a  sensitive  duties  position,  or  for  those  Service  Members  attending special operations courses identified later in this section. 
5.29.1.2.  MTF and RCMU records managers at the departure or losing  MTF or RCMU are  required  to  forward  the  health  records  (outpatient  medical  and  dental  records)  for 
departing  Service  Members,  to  the  gaining  MTF  or  RCMU  responsible  for  maintaining the Service Member‘s health records.  Health records will be mailed NLT five duty days 
following the Service Member‘s PCS/PCA departure or date of separation/transition to the  Reserve  Component.    Mail  the  records  via  standard  First  Class  U.S.  mail  with 
immediate delivery confirmation/acknowledgment, certified mail, or other commercially available  option,  e.g.,  FedEx,  that  offers  package  tracking  and/or  arrival  confirmation. 
Use of standard First Class U.S. Postal Service mailing method alone, without immediate delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment  or  certified  mail  receipt,  is  prohibited.  Return 
receipt  confirmation  must  not  be  dependent  upon  the  timeliness  or  willingness  of  the destination MTF to complete a DD Form 2825, Internal Receipt, or other manual delivery 
confirmation receipt option. 5.29.1.3.  The Service Member is required to present military PCS orders or duty location 
reassignment  orders  to  the  departure  or  losing  MTF  or  to  the  RCMU  prior  to  final departure  from  the  installation  or  organization.  Records  managers  at  the  losing  MTF  or 
RCMU will include a copy of the Service Member‘s PCS orders in the same mailing shipment package bound for the gaining MTF or destination medical unit. 
5.29.1.4.  MTF  and  DTF  In/Out-Processing  PCS  Customer  Service  Locations:    Ideally, each  MTF  and  DTF  should  provide  one  central  in-processing  and   out-processing 
customer  service  location  for  health  records  respective  to  each  facility.    For  the installation DTF, this location is usually the front clinic reception desk.  However, some 
MTFs  have  decentralized  outpatient  medical  record  rooms.    Although  one  central  MTF 
----------------Page (278) Break----------------
  280  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
outpatient medical records customer service and/or reception area is recommended, MTF Commanders  may  choose  instead  to  align  multiple  outpatient  medical  customer  service 
locations alongside or co-located with PCM or PCMH clinic operations. 5.29.1.5.  Airmen  PCS  Departure  Out-Processing  Procedures:    All  Service  Members 
empanelled to the MTF and scheduled for reassignment to another station are required to ―out-process‖ through the MTF and DTF before final installation departure.  The purpose 
of the out-processing visit is to ensure MTF and DTF records managers know to remove the  Service Member‘s outpatient medical and dental records from the main file and 
prepare the record(s) for shipment to the gaining MTF. 5.29.1.6.  Airmen  projected  for  installation  departure  related  to  a  PCS  reassignment  are 
required to clear the DTF and MTF no earlier than the 5th duty day BEFORE their final installation  out-processing  MPS  appointment.    This  time  period  restriction  ensures 
outpatient  medical  and  dental  records  will  be  readily  available  to  medical  and  dental providers up until the time the member leaves the base. 
5.29.1.7.  During  each  respective  out-processing  appointment,  Airmen  are  required  to provide  four  copies  of  their  orders  (two  copies  for  the  DTF,  two  copies  for  the  MTF).  
Again,  some  MTFs  have  decentralized  MTF  records  rooms.    Depending  on  local operating policy, Service Member‘s may be required to visit a centrally located MTF 
records customer service office or out-process through their PCM records room location.  MTF  &  DTF  records  personnel  will  ensure  local  installation  out-processing  checklists 
include MTF & DTF records out-processing requirements. 5.29.1.8.  DTF  Record  Processing:    No  later  than  the  close  of  business  each  duty  day, 
DTF  records  managers  will  ensure  two  copies  of  each  departing  Airman‘s  PCS reassignment  orders  are  filed  properly.    One  copy  will  be  placed  on  top  of  all  other 
documents  in  Section  II  of  the  AF  Form  2100b  series,  Dental  Treatment  Record.    The second copy will be placed in a plastic AF Form 885-887 series, Medical Record Charge-
Out Guide. 5.29.1.8.1.  Complete  an  AF  Form  250,  Health  Record  Charge-Out  Guide  Request 
and  insert  into  the  upper  right  identification  slot  on  the  charge-out-guide.    File  the charge-out  guide  into  the  main  file  according  to  terminal-digit  order - just  like  the 
original dental record.  The charge-out guide will remain for 90 calendar days.  At the end  of  this  period,  if  any  loose,  late-flowing  dental  documents  are  discovered,  then 
place the documents and the copy of the PCS reassignment order in an envelope and mail directly from the DTF to the member‘s gaining DTF.  Do not forward these late, 
loose flowing documents to the MTF outpatient records office. 5.29.1.8.2.  No  later  than  the  close  of  business  on  the  duty  day  following  the 
member‘s  out-processing  visit,  DTF  records   managers   will  forward  the  dental treatment record(s) to either a central MTF records room or to the PCM records room 
where  the  Service  Member  is  empanelled.    After  receiving  the  dental  treatment record(s),  MTF  records  managers  may  temporarily  stage  the  records  in  a  separate 
location,  away  from  the  main  outpatient  medical  file.    Local  MTF  policy  must  be established  to  identify  the  best  method  for  transferring  the  dental  treatment  records 
from the dental clinic to the MTF. 
----------------Page (279) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   281  
5.29.1.8.3.  Dental  record  managers  will  document  the  date  and  forwarding  location of each dental treatment  record  removed from the dental records main file using the 
current local or standard dental records tracking mechanism. 5.29.1.9.  MTF  Record  Processing:    No  later  than  the  close  of  business  each  duty  day, 
MTF  records  managers  will  ensure  two  copies  of  each  departing  Airman‘s  PCS reassignment  orders  are  filed  properly.    One  copy  will  be  placed  on  top  of  all  other 
documents  in  Section  II  of  the  AF  Form  2100A  series,  Outpatient  Treatment  Record.  The  second  copy  will  be  placed  in  a  plastic  AF  Form  885-887  series,  Medical  Record 
Charge-Out Guide. 5.29.1.9.1.  Complete  an  AF  Form  250,  Health  Record  Charge-Out  Guide  Request 
and  insert  into  the  upper  right  identification  slot  on  the  charge-out-guide.    File  the charge-out  guide  into  the  main  file  according  to  terminal-digit  order - just  like  the 
original outpatient medical record.  The charge-out guide will remain for 90 calendar days.    At  the  end  of this  period,  if  any  loose,  late-flowing  dental  documents  are 
discovered, then place the documents and the copy of the PCS reassignment order in an envelope and mail directly from the MTF to the member‘s gaining MTF. 
5.29.1.9.2.  MTF  records  managers  are  required  to  mail  the  medical  and  dental records bundled together, to the gaining MTF, RCMU, or to the gaining medical unit 
responsible for the daily maintenance of the record, NLT five duty days following the Service  Member‘s  installation  departure date.      Ensure   a   copy   of   the   Service 
Member‘s PCS reassignment or service component transition orders have been placed inside  the  dental  treatment  and  outpatient  medical  records.    Mail  the  records  via 
standard        First        Class        U.S.        mail        with        immediate        delivery confirmation/acknowledgment, certified mail, or other commercially available option, 
e.g., FedEx, that offers package tracking and/or arrival confirmation.  Use of standard First  Class  U.S.  Postal  Service  mailing  method  alone,  without  immediate  delivery 
confirmation/acknowledgment  or  certified  mail  receipt,  is  prohibited.  Return  receipt confirmation  must  not  be  dependent  upon  the  timeliness  or  willingness  of  the 
destination  MTF  to  complete  a  DD  Form  2825,  Internal  Receipt,  or  other  manual delivery confirmation receipt option. 
5.29.1.9.3.  Select and enter the appropriate transfer code in the CHCS MRT module and enter the name of gaining MTF in the ―MTF Location Remarks Section.‖ 
5.29.1.9.4.  Keep and maintain a copy of the member‘s PCS orders and  place  into  a plastic Medical Record Charge-Out Guide.  File the charge-out guide in the main file, 
according to member‘s SSN, and remove after 90 days. 5.29.1.9.5.  After  90  days,  retrieve  the  charge-out  guide  from  the  main  file  and 
forward any ―loose‖ or late flowing documents that may have collected in the charge-out guide to the gaining MTF, RCMU, or to the gaining medical unit responsible for 
the daily maintenance of the record.  Place loose documents in an envelope and mail to the gaining MTF or RCMU.  Mail the loose medical documents via standard First 
Class  U.S.  mail  with  immediate  delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment,  certified mail,  or  other  commercially  available  option,  e.g.,  FedEx,  that  offers  package 
tracking and/or  arrival confirmation. Use of standard First Class U.S. Postal Service mailing  method  alone, without  immediate delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment  or 
----------------Page (280) Break----------------
  282  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
certified  mail  receipt,  is  prohibited.    Return  receipt  confirmation  must  not  be dependent  upon  the  timeliness  or  willingness  of  the  destination  MTF  to  complete  a 
DD  Form  2825,  Internal  Receipt,  or  other  manual  delivery  confirmation  receipt option. 
5.29.2.  Transferring   Service   Member   STRs   During   PCS,   PCA   or   Duty   Location Reassignment   to   Forward   or   Foreign   Combat/Combat Support   Theater   of   Operations 
Locations,  or  Other Overseas  Deployment  Locations  for  Airmen  Not  Assigned  to  Sensitive Duties or Active Flight Status. 
5.29.2.1.  For  365-day  PCS  and/or  extended  deployments  to  the  Area  of  Responsibility (AOR),  overseas  combat/campaign  theater  of  operations,  combat  zones,  or  combat 
support locations, the Service Member‘s original STR will remain at the MTF for which he or she was recently enrolled until the Service Member either returns from deployment 
or receives a ―follow-on‖ PCS assignment to another installation.  Obtain two copies of the  PCS  orders  and  place  one  copy  of  each  inside  the  original  outpatient  medical  and 
dental treatment records  in Section  I or attach to the left side folder flap  on top of most current DD Form 2766,  Adult Preventive and Chronic Care  Flowsheet, dental treatment 
encounter  form,  service  transition  order,  or  AF  Form  1288,  Application  for  Ready Reserve Assignment. 
5.29.2.2.  Following  the  AD  or  RCSM‘s  deployment  medical  clearance,  established during  the  MTF  pre-deployment  screening,  and  before  the  Service  Member  finishes 
departure  PCS  out-processing,  print  the  most  current  version  of  the  Preventive  Health Assessment  and  Individual  Medical  Readiness  (PIMR)  DD  Form  2766  and  DD  Form 
2766C (Immunization History Continuation Form) and place them into the cardstock DD Form  2766  (secured  with  the  metal  prongs).  Include  paper  copies  of  any  medical 
information  that  documents  chronic medical  conditions  or  any  documents  ordered  to  be copied and placed into the Service Member‘s DD Form 2766.  The Service Member (or a 
deployment chalk commander or deployment team leader) is responsible for transporting the original  DD  Form  2766  along  with  the documents  listed  above,  leaving  the original 
outpatient medical and dental treatment record and a copy of the DD Form 2766 behind at the Service Member‘s home MTF. 
5.29.2.3.  When  the  Service  Member  returns  to  his/her  home  installation,  the  DD  Form 2766 and any documents generated in theater are removed from the DD Form 2766 and 
filed  in  their  respective  sections  inside  the  original  outpatient  medical  and/or  dental treatment record. If the Service Member has received an order to proceed to a follow-on 
PCS  re-assignment  installation,  the  gaining  MTF  will  request the Service Member‘s original  outpatient  medical  and  dental  treatment  records  from  the  departure  or  losing 
home installation MTF. 5.29.2.4.  Exception: When a Service Member receives a 365-day PCS order to proceed 
to the 386 EMDG/EMEDS (Ali Al Salem), the Service Member will hand-carry his/her original  outpatient  medical  and  dental  treatment  records  (in  a  sealed  package – secured 
by the departure MTF).  Upon arrival, the Service Member is required to relinquish their health  records  to  the  EMEDS  facility  or  to  the  installation  MTF.  (Note: As  additional 
AOR,  theater  or  combat  and  combat  support  sites  are  adequately  resourced  to  manage 
----------------Page (281) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   283  
medical  records,  these  facilities  will  be  identified  and  added  to  the  exception  list maintained by AFMOA/SGAT). 
5.29.3.  Transferring   Service   Member   STRs   During   PCS,   PCA   or   Duty   Location Reassignment  for  Air  Force  Members  Empanelled  to  Sister-Service  MTFs:    The  fact  that 
some Airmen are enrolled to non-Air Force MTFs may pose a noteworthy challenge, but this scenario  does  not  prohibit  the  accurate  and  timely  health  records  transfer  process.    Health 
records for Service Members are normally maintained at the MTF where the member obtains his/her primary care, regardless of service affiliation.  To facilitate appropriate health records 
transfer  procedures  for  Air Force  Service  Members, health  records  management  officials  at Air Force MTFs located nearest to the Service Member‘s sister-service  PCM/MTF location 
must  establish  a  local  memorandum  of  agreement  or  support  agreement  with  the  sister-service MTF and the Service Member‘s servicing MPS to ensure all final out-processing 
documents,   checklist   requirements,   MPS-generated   PCS   notices,   and   PCS   orders   are completed  and/or  forwarded  between  and/or  to  each  appropriate  agency  for  necessary 
processing  action.    The  agreement  must  identify  how  the  health  records  of  Air  Force personnel will transfer to the MTF at the next duty location.  Transfer options may include, 
but are not limited to instructions that specify health records be, a) mailed to the requesting Air  Force  MTF  by  the  sister-service MTF, b) forwarded to the MTF at the Airman‘s next 
duty location or, c) provided to the Service Member (if the Airman is assigned to a sensitive duties  program  or  active  flight  status)  in  a  sealed  envelope  by  the  sister-service  MTF 
according to written local instructions that clearly define the minimum records custody rules, requirements,  and  prohibitions  (IAW  DoDI  6040.43.  and  this  instruction)  regarding  record 
hand-carrying allowances or case-by-case MTF Commander waiver authority. 5.29.3.1.  Note:  If   an   agreement   between   the   sister-service   PCM/MTF,   the   local 
installation MPS and the MTF nearest to the Service Member‘s GSU cannot be reached, the local MPS and the nearest MTF may have to initiate local procedures that are fair and 
equitable  to  both  organizations  to  ensure  the  health  records  located  at  non-Air  Force MTFs are properly forwarded and delivered to the Airman‘s next duty station support 
MTF. 5.29.4.  Active  Duty  Virtual  MPS  Checklist  Confirmation.        Historically,  only  the  MTF 
Force Health Management (FHM) staff had access to the Virtual MPS.  In May 2010, AFPC directed all MPSs to authorize MTF and  DTF Records Rooms access.    MTF health records 
offices   have   been   added   as   mandatory   out-processing   checklist   destinations   for   each outbound Service Member.  Although the FHM may have additional medical out-processing 
checklist  approval  authority  or  obligations,  they  should  not  ―sign  off‖  or  approve  any outpatient  medical  or  dental  treatment  record  out-processing tasks on a Service Member‘s 
Virtual MPS out-processing checklist.  Outpatient medical and dental records managers and FHM officials will work together to ensure each outbound Airmen has fulfilled all of his or 
her MTF out-processing responsibilities. 5.29.4.1.  Checklist  Operation:  Multiple  (at  least  two)  staff  members  assigned  to  MTF 
and  DTF  records  departments  be  granted  Virtual  MPS  Checklist  access  to  ensure  each departing Service Member is informed of the requirement to provide the MTF and DTF 
with  copies  of  his/her orders at  the time of  MTF/DTF  out-processing.    Access  will  also allow MTF records managers to obtain and print individual retirement/separation orders 
when necessary.

5.29.5.  Transferring  Outpatient  Medical  and  Dental  Records  between  MTFs  for  Family Members,  Retired  Military  Service  Members,  or  Any  Other  Category  of  Beneficiary  Not 
Specifically Captured in this Section. 5.29.5.1.  According  to  DoDI  6040.43,  MHS  beneficiaries  are  prohibited  from  hand-
carrying their medical records. The practice of mailing family member hard-copy, paper-based, outpatient medical and dental treatment records from one MTF to another during a 
PCS/PCA reassignment, personal relocation move, or PCM reassignment is now standard procedure  throughout  the  AFMS.  Only  the  MTF  Commander  can  make  a  case-by-case 
exception to deviate from this process. 5.29.5.2.  Upon  notification  from  the  sponsor  that  he  or  she  is  being  re-assigned  to 
another installation,  MTF  outpatient  medical  records  personnel  will  check  the  Service Member‘s  typed  PCS/PCA  orders  to  determine  if  the  reassignment  is  to  be 
―ACCOMPANIED‖ (with family members) or ―UNACCOMPANIED‖ (without family members).  If the Service Member‘s reassignment  orders  indicate  family  members  will 
accompany  the  Service  Member  to  his  or  her  next  destination,  then  MTF  records personnel  will  ask  the  Service  Member  if  all  of  the  family  members  are  expected  to 
accompany  him  or  her.  If  all  family  members  are  accompanying  the  Service  member, then MTF  records  personnel  will  verify  the  departure  date  with  the sponsor,  obtain  any 
available  dental  treatment  records,  and  then  combine  all  of  the  family  member  health records  into  one  package  (if  reasonably  able  to  do  so  without  weakening  the  mailing 
envelope or package). MTF records personnel may also add the sponsor‘s STR into the same package.  If the package  is  too  big  or  it  becomes  impractical  to  combine  all  of  the 
family‘s records together, then separate the Service Member‘s record from the package and mail separately. Enclose a copy of the sponsor‘s typed PCS/PCA reassignment orders 
in  each  package.  Mail  the  health  records  package(s)  to  the  destination  MTF  NLT  five calendar days following the sponsor‘s departure date. 
5.29.5.3.  If the Active Duty sponsor indicates that one or more family members are NOT accompanying  him  or  her  to  the  next  installation  or  if  the  sponsor‘s  PCS/PCA 
reassignment orders indicate UNACCOMPANIED, MTF records personnel must verify, with the sponsor, if the remaining family member health record(s) should stay behind at 
the current MTF or whether the remaining health records should be forwarded to another facility where MTF TRICARE enrollment is expected.  Inform the sponsor that if family 
members are expected to receive direct healthcare at another MTF, apart from where the sponsor  will  be  enrolled,  then  upon  arrival  and/or  TRICARE  re-enrollment  at  the  new 
MTF,  the  sponsor,  spouse,  or  legally-aged  family  member  must  contact  the  outpatient medical  records  department  to  complete  the  necessary  records  request  paperwork.  Only 
after receiving a properly completed DD Form 2138, Request for Transfer of Outpatient Record  or  a  DD  Form  877,  Request  for  Medical/Dental  Records,  or  another  suitable 
request  form,  from  the  requesting  MTF,  will  the  Air  Force  MTF  (where  health  records are currently maintained) release and forward the requested records. 
5.29.5.4.  For  retired  Service  Members,  their  family  members,  and  active  duty  family members who  wish  to  change  their  MTF  PCM  and/or  MTF  TRICARE  enrollment 
location,  without  associated  sponsor  PCS/PCA  or  duty  location  reassignment,  whether the move be across the country or within a multi-market service location (e.g., changing 
MTF/PCM   location   within   the   San   Antonio,   TX;   Washington,   DC;   or   Hampton 
----------------Page (283) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   285  
Roads/Norfolk/Portsmouth,  VA - Tidewater  area),  inform  the  sponsor  that  upon  arrival and/or  TRICARE  re-enrollment  at  the  new  MTF,  the  sponsor,  spouse,  or  legally-aged 
family  member  must  contact  the outpatient  medical  records  department  to  complete the necessary  records  request  paperwork.  Only  after  receiving  a  properly  completed  DD 
Form  2138,  Request  for  Transfer  of  Outpatient  Record  or  a  DD  Form  877,  Request  for Medical/Dental Records, or another suitable request form (from the requesting MTF) will 
the Air Force MTF (where health records  are  currently maintained) release and forward the  requested  records.  If  the  sponsor  contacts  the  departure  or  losing  MTF  before  the 
anticipated MTH change, provide the sponsor with a DD Form 2138. Instruct the sponsor to complete Sections I and II of form and deliver the form to the MTF records department 
at the gaining MTF where TRICARE re-enrollment is expected. 5.29.5.5.  Under  all  circumstances  when  mailing  health  records  or  when  mailing  loose, 
late  flowing  medical  documents,  MTF  records  personnel  will  use  standard  First  Class U.S. mail with immediate delivery confirmation/acknowledgment, certified mail, or other 
commercially  available  option,  e.g.,  FedEx,  that  offers  package  tracking  and/or  arrival confirmation.  Use  of  standard  First  Class  U.S.  Postal  Service  mailing  method  alone, 
without  immediate  delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment  or  certified  mail  receipt,  is prohibited.    Return  receipt  confirmation  must  not be  dependent  upon  the  timeliness  or 
willingness  of  the  destination  MTF  to  complete  a  DD  Form  2825,  Internal  Receipt,  or other manual delivery confirmation receipt option. 
5.29.5.6.  MTF  Commanders  (Custodians  of  Record  or  their  delegates)  may  make exceptions  to  the  hand-carrying  policy  on  a  CASE-BY-CASE  basis  if  extenuating 
circumstances warrant it. No sponsor is authorized to possess or hand-carry the original health records or copies of health records for any member of his/her family aged 18 years 
or older without written permission from the family member. 5.29.5.7.  Forward  health  records  critical  to  potential,  pending,  or  active  litigation  using 
ONLY Certified Mail via official military mail or U.S. Postal System.  Packages will be mailed  with  an  immediate  delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment  feature,  or  other 
commercially  available  option,  e.g.,  FedEx,  that  offers  package  tracking  and/or  arrival confirmation.  Use  of  standard  First  Class  U.S.  Postal  Service  mailing  method  alone, 
without immediate delivery confirmation/acknowledgment, is prohibited. 5.29.6.  Disposition  of  Family  Member  Outpatient  Medical  and  Dental  Records  When  the 
Sponsor has a 365-day PCS to an Overseas Location in Support of Contingency Operations. 5.29.6.1.  If  the  Service  Member‘s  PCS  is  identified  as  ACCOMPANIED  on  the 
sponsor‘s orders, the outpatient medical and dental records for all family members will remain at the losing or ―home base‖ facility until the Service Member either returns from 
deployment  or  receives  a  follow-on  PCS  assignment  to  another  location.    Only  upon request,  provide  copies  of  family  member  medical  records  (including  AHLTA  patient 
encounters) to the sponsor and/or any legally-aged family member. 5.29.6.2.  If  requested  by the  sponsor  or  any  legally-aged  Upon  return  from  a  365-day 
PCS  overseas  location,  if  the  sponsor  receives  a  follow-on  assignment  to  a  different installation he or she will contact the gaining MTF upon arrival (at the new installation) 
and  initiate  a  formal  request  to  obtain  his  or  her  family-member  dependent  medical records from the losing MTF. 
----------------Page (284) Break----------------
  286  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.29.6.3.  If the Service member‘s PCS is identified as UNACCOMPANIED on the orders, determine where the family member‘s MTF TRICARE enrollment is expected 
and mail records package accordingly or leave the records at the losing MTF if the family member remains enrolled there. 
5.29.6.4.  Insert  a  charge  out  guide  with  a  copy  of  PCS  orders,  DD  Form  877,  or  DD Form  2138.  File  all  loose  medical  documents in  the  appropriate  charge  out  guide.  
Maintain  loose,  late-flowing  documents  no  more  than  90  days.    If,  after  90  days  have expired  and  one  or  more  loose,  late-flowing  documents  has  been  placed  inside  the 
charge-out  guide,  remove  the  document(s),  place  in  a sealed  envelope,  and  mail  to  the gaining     MTF.          Packages     will     be     mailed     with     an     immediate     delivery 
confirmation/acknowledgment  feature,  or  other  commercially  available  option,  e.g., FedEx,  that  offers  package  tracking  and/or  arrival  confirmation.  Use  of  standard  First 
Class   U.S.   Postal   Service   mailing   method   alone,   without   immediate   delivery confirmation/acknowledgment, is prohibited. 
5.29.6.5.  When  individuals  who are  not  attached  to  the base  are  receiving  medical  care on base (for example, AFIT students), identify their records by entering their status on the 
record folder, in pencil. Do not forward these records except at the patient‘s specific request. 
5.29.6.6.  When mailing records pertinent to litigation cases, medical records and claims files will be mailed via certified mail/return receipt. 
5.29.7.  Transferring Mental Health Records. 5.29.7.1.  See AFI 44-172 for procedures detailing the transfer of Mental Health Records. 
5.30.  Providing Health Records to Active Duty Members During TDY Periods. 5.30.1.  With  the  enterprise-wide  use  of  the  EHR,  there  are  very  few  situations  where  an 
Airman would be required to bring his or her paper outpatient and/or dental records to a TDY location.  Most  Professional  Military  Education  (PME)  and  technical  training  schools  no 
longer require students to bring their original medical record or copies of recent encounters. As  a  general  rule,  MTF  outpatient  records  departments  should  only  provide  the  original 
outpatient  medical  record  to  the  member  if,  a)  specifically  required  per  formal  training requirements (TDY orders must include this requirement in writing on the orders), b) if the 
member  has  a  chronic  medical  condition  where  reference  of  the  medical  record  could  be useful  during  treatment  at  the  TDY  location,  or  c)  in  any  situation  that  a  provider  deems 
medically  necessary  for  the  member  to  hand-carry  his/her  record  while  TDY.  Ensure  all pertinent EHR documents are printed and filed into the record prior to the Service Member‘s 
departure. If an original health record is to be provided, the record(s) must be enclosed in a strong envelope or package and sealed. 
5.30.2.  Exceptions. 5.30.2.1.  Specialty  Combat  Rescue  and  Survival  and  Evasion  Schools:  The  Air  Force 
Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) School and the Combat Rescue Officer Selection Course (CROSC) Course VS0V94-C. Often the remote location of these unique 
training environments does not allow EHR access. Students bound for SERE or CROSC training  may  be  required  to  bring  their  paper  (hard  copy)  outpatient  medical  record  or 
----------------Page (285) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   287  
copies of their most recent patient encounters.  Ideally, students approved  and scheduled for  these  training  courses  will  contact  the  MTF  outpatient  records  department to  either 
obtain their original outpatient medical records or copies of the most pertinent portions of the  medical  record  well  in  advance  of  their  class  start  date.  If  faced  with  the  task  of 
providing  last-minute‖  records  or  copies,  MTF  records  personnel will  expedite  the student‘s request.  If the specialty school requires the original paper medical record, 
obtain one copy of the student‘s TDY orders and place inside a plastic AF Form 885-887 series, Medical Record  Charge-Out Guide. Place the Charge-Out Guide  in the main  file 
where  the  original  medical  record  was  located  for  the  duration  of  the  TDY  period.    If providing copies, include the cardstock DD Form 2766, a current copy  of the DD Form 
2766C, and the last six months worth of printed EHR encounters. The record(s) must be enclosed  in  a  strong  envelope or  package  and  sealed.  If  either SERE  or  CROSC  course 
officials   require   only   copies   instead   of   original   outpatient   medical   records,   MTF personnel are required to provide the original DD Form 2766, a current copy of the DD 
Form  2766C,  and  the  last  6  months  of  printed  EHR  historical  encounters.  These documents should be placed in an envelope and handed directly to the Service Member. 
Advise the member that he must return the DD Form 2766 to the MTF upon return from the TDY. 
5.30.2.2.  Airmen who will be assigned to, perform, or fill an active Flight status job or position  or  active  sensitive duties  program  (PRP,  PSP,  etc.)  job  or  position  while at  the 
TDY location shall hand-carry their STR to the TDY location. Flyers traveling to another military   installation   (to   fulfill   professional   or   continuing   military   or   professional 
education requirements, when not assigned to an operational flight position), who remain for  no  more  than  six  months,  usually  do  not need  to  bring  their  paper  STR.  Instead,  a 
current  copy  of  the  AF  Form  1042,  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special Operational Duty should be enough to satisfy training program acceptance requirements. 
Flyers  should  obtain  this  form  (or  a  copy)  from their  flight  medicine  physician  before leaving for their TDY assignment. 
5.30.2.2.1.  The  competent  medical  authority,  Senior  Flight  Medicine  Physician, and/or  sensitive  duties  program  integrity  manager  at  the  MTF  at  the  TDY  location 
will continue to perform all standard patient evaluations and duty capability/limitation unit   notifications   (following   a   patient   encounter)   between   the   MTF   and   unit 
commanders   or   operational   unit   sensitive   duties   program   officials   to   maintain continued  program  integrity  for  Airmen  traveling  to  or  temporarily  assigned  to 
another military installation. 5.30.2.2.1.1.  Each documented automated patient encounter for active flyers and 
sensitive duty participants will be printed from the EHR and filed into the Service Member‘s STR so that required hand written/stamped individual medical duty 
capability/limitation    unit    commander    notifications    may    be    permanently documented.  Following  the  completion  of  all  official  TDY  duties,  local  MTF 
records  personnel  will  provide  the original  Service  Member  with  his  or  her original  STR  to  hand-carry  back  to  their  home  installation.  The  STR  must  be 
enclosed in a strong envelope or package and sealed. In those instances where the original  STR  was  not  carried  to  the  TDY  location,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the 
TDY MTF Flight to mail the printed AHLTA encounters back to the Airman‘s

host   MTF.      Use   standard   First   Class   U.S.   mail   with   immediate   delivery confirmation/acknowledgment,  certified  mail,  or  other  commercially  available 
option, e.g., FedEx, that offers package tracking and/or arrival confirmation.  Use of  standard  First  Class  U.S.  Postal  Service  mailing  method  alone,  without 
immediate  delivery  confirmation/acknowledgment  or  certified  mail  receipt,  is prohibited.   Return   receipt   confirmation   must   not   be   dependent   upon   the 
timeliness  or  willingness  of  the  destination  MTF  to  complete  a  DD  Form  2825, Internal Receipt, or other manual delivery confirmation receipt option. 
5.30.3.  For  all  TDY  Airmen  normally  assigned  to  a  sensitive duties  program  (PRP,  PSP, etc.) who are not expected to perform or fill an active operational sensitive duties position or 
job  at  the  TDY  location,  are  not  required  to  hand-carry  their  STR  to  the  TDY.  Following each episode of care at the TDY location, personnel assigned to the sensitive duties program 
support office, flight medicine clinic or any official(s) responsible for managing the integrity of the MTF portion of the sensitive duties program notification system, will print out a copy 
of the EHR note and mail a copy (via Certified military or U.S. Mail with immediate delivery confirmation/package tracking) to the MTF at the Airman‘s home station.  MTF personnel at 
the TDY location will also provide a copy of the printed EHR note to the Service Member. The  Service  Member  is  required  to  bring  the  printed  EHR  note  to  his  or  her  provider  at 
his/her  home  station.  The  returning  Airman‘s  provider  is  required  to  review  the  EHR document (either the mailed copy or the copy provided by the Service Member) to identify 
any  potential  medical  issues  that  could  jeopardize  overall  program  integrity  or  reliability based upon the patient‘s capabilities/limitations (if any) documented or identified at the TDY 
location. 5.30.4.  Before  health  records  are  provided  to  the  member,  outpatient  and/or  dental  records 
personnel  shall  seal  the  record(s)  in  an  appropriately  sized  envelope,  then  write  or  place  a pre-worded  ink  stamp  that  indicates,  ―During  Transport,  Open  Only  for  Medical 
Emergencies,‖  across  the  envelope  sealed flap  seam.  Then  place  one  strip  of  clear  or transparent ½ inch adhesive tape down the entire length of the envelope along the sealed flap 
seam.  The  records  management  official  that  seals  the  envelope  must  write  his/her  initials along  the  sealed  flap  seam  and  write  or  place  a  pre-worded  ink  stamp  that  identifies  the 
losing  MTF  or  installation  DTF  unit  name,  office  symbol,  address,  installation  name,  zip code, POC name and contact telephone number. 
5.30.5.  Inform  the  member  that  the  original  medical record  must  be  returned  to  the  MTF records  department  within  24  hours  upon  returning  from  school  or  the  first  available  duty 
day. Have the member sign the record out using the AF Form 1942, Clinic Index. This form acts as a receipt allowing the member to hand-carry their record to TDY location and they are 
responsible for returning the government property. 
Section 5C—Inpatient Records Administration 
5.31.  Creating Inpatient Records. 5.31.1.  Develop and maintain inpatient records using guidelines from this chapter and from 
Joint Commission standards.  Records are to be completed within 30 days after the patient‘s discharge  IAW  Joint  Commission  standards.    Prepare  an  inpatient  record  for  the  following 
episodes: 
----------------Page (287) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   289  
5.31.1.1.  Patients admitted to an inpatient unit of an Air Force MTF, including patients admitted and discharged before midnight on the day of admission regardless of the type 
of discharge. 5.31.1.1.1.  Reactivate the record of hospitalization if the patient is readmitted before 
midnight  on  the  same  day  as  discharged  for  the  same  reason  as  the  first  admission. The attending provider annotates the reason for readmission and the hospitalization is 
considered as one continuous period. 5.31.1.1.2.  If the patient is readmitted after midnight, or the reason for readmission is 
different from that of the previous admission, create a new record. 5.31.1.2.  Live  births  occurring  in  an  Air  Force  MTF.  Note:  Do  not  create  a  separate 
record for stillbirth infants.  All paperwork, including the autopsy (if performed), will be filed in the mother‘s inpatient record. 
5.31.1.3.  Patients  who  die  in  transit.    The  MTF  receiving  the  remains  processes  the records and completes the AF Form 565 as if the patient had transferred in. 
5.31.1.4.  All  patients  admitted  to  an  EMEDS  facility  or  fixed  contingency  hospital during   deployment.      See   Section   5D,   Deployed   Assignment   Medical   Record 
Management for further instructions. 5.31.2.  A  ―canceled admission‖  may  be  appropriate  in  some  instances.    Annotate  the 
admission worksheet with the reason for cancellation and place  all paperwork  generated by the admission (e.g., history and physical, progress notes, laboratory and x-ray reports, etc...) 
in  the  patient‘s outpatient record folder.  Record and code the episode as an outpatient encounter. 
5.32.  Creation of the Master Patient Index (MPI). 5.32.1.  The  MPI  serves  as  an  alphabetical  index  of  all  hospital  patients  and  patients  for 
whom administrative  responsibility  is  assumed  (e.g.,  active  duty  military  in  non-federal MTFs).  Note:  Do not destroy - maintain for 50 years. 
5.32.2.  The MPI is created by and stored in the current automated system. 5.32.3.  MTFs  without  automated A&D functions will maintain either ―hard-copy‖ paper 
index cards or easily accessible and properly maintained DD Forms 739, Register of Patients as a source for locating prior admission data. 
5.33.  Preparing Inpatient Record Folders. 5.33.1.  Number folders according to the sponsor‘s social security number (SSN).  Place an 
automated bar code patient identification label in the upper right corner of the record jacket cover in the Patient Identification block.  Document the record jacket cover according to the 
following table: 
----------------Page (288) Break----------------
  290  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
 
Table 5.3.  Preparing Inpatient Record Folders. 
If the patient is: Use SSN of: 
Active Duty/Reserve Component Service Member 
Family Member Sponsor 
Civilian Employee Employee 
Retired military Member 
Civilian Emergency Patient 
Foreign national, allied or other military member without SSN Construct a SSN  
5.33.2.  See paragraph 5.10.6. for guidance regarding the creation of a ―pseudo‖ SSN when a patient‘s own SSN is not known or does not exist. 
5.33.3.  Select an AF Form in the 788A-788J series, as appropriate, according to the last two digits  of  the  applicable  SSN.    Enter  patient  identification  information  on  the  front  of  the 
folder. 5.33.3.1.  Print  the  first  name,  middle initial,  and  last  name  of  the  patient  in  the  space 
provided with a black pen, felt-tip marker, or embossed card.  Address labels prepared by the  Personnel  Data  System  may  be  used  to  provide  names  of  military  personnel.    DO 
NOT use pencil for any entry.  Always place information in the upper right-hand corner of the jacket cover in the patient ID area. 
5.33.3.2.  Enter the sponsor‘s SSN in the preprinted blocks in the upper right-hand corner of the record. 
5.33.3.3.  Enter the family member prefix in the two circles next to the SSN. 5.33.3.4.  Fill  in  the  ½-inch  square  block,  along  the  right  edge  of  the  back  leaf  of  the 
folder, containing the same digit as the last digit of the SSN, with a black ink pen, felt-tip marker, or black tape. 
5.33.3.5.  On the outside, front cover of the inpatient record jacket, in the pre-printed or labeled treatment  year grid section, fill-in the current treatment  year that  corresponds to 
the patient‘s most recent inpatient treatment.  Use a black felt-tip marker or black pen. 5.33.3.6.  Indicate the patient‘s status in the appropriate block on the front. 
5.33.3.7.  Attach  the  CHCS  MRT  bar  code  label  to  the  inpatient  record  folder.    See  the MRTR2 User Guide for instructions on label requirements. 
5.33.3.8.  Stamping or labeling the front cover of the medical record with any large-letter identifiers  other  than  ―CROSS-REFERENCE,‖  or  with  infant-adoption    related 
notifications  is  discouraged.    See  paragraph  4.3.10.  for  detailed  information  regarding infant-adoption medical information release instructions.

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   291  
5.33.4.  Documents  placed  in  the  folder  may  be  held  together  with  a  3-inch  fastener  or fastened into the folder.  When records are retired to the NPRC, documents are permanently 
affixed to the folder. 5.34.  Contents of the Inpatient Record. 
5.34.1.  Upon the patient‘s disposition, arrange paper copies of forms in the order listed below  as  applicable  to  the  case.   Note:  As  MTFs  increase  their  use  of  Essentris  or  other 
automated  systems  to  create  a  computer-based  patient  record,  the  style  and  arrangement  of data  in  the  electronic  record  may  vary  from  the  guidance  provided  here.    Records  printed 
from  automated  systems  should  be  assembled  as  closely  as  possible  to  the  traditional inpatient record until more detailed instructions are published.  An asterisk ―*‖ denotes that 
the  form  may  not  be  filed  in  the  order  listed.    See  instruction  column  for  proper  filing location.  Command and locally developed medical forms should be filed in the appropriate 
order as according to purpose.  See Attachment 16 for arrangement of forms in the inpatient record. 
5.34.2.  Problem  Oriented  Medical  Record  (POMR).    If  an  MTF  elects  to  use  the  POMR format, develop local directives to prescribe which cases will use this format, the method by

reason  for  hospitalization;  significant  findings;  procedures performed  and  care,  treatment, and services provided; patient‘s condition at discharge; and instructions to the patient and 
family as appropriate.‖  Consideration should be given to instructions relating to physical activity,  medication,  diet  and  follow-up activity.    The  condition  of  the  patient  on  discharge 
should be stated in terms that permit a specific measurable comparison with the condition on admission, avoiding the use of vague relative terminology, such as ―improved.‖  When 
preprinted instructions are given to the patient or family, the record should so indicate and a sample  of  the  instruction  sheet  in  use  at  the  time  should  be  on  file  in  the  medical  record 
department. 5.37.5.1.  The healthcare provider dictates a concise clinical resume (narrative summary)

coding in the APV record for auditing and quality assurance purposes. 5.40.6.  Admission of APV Patients. 
5.40.6.1.  Admit  as  an  inpatient  an  APV  patient  that  stays  beyond  the  time  limit  of  23 hours and 59 minutes.  Time commences when the patient is checked in for preliminary 
work-up for the procedure. 5.40.6.2.  Do not backdate or change the time of the admission date and time to the point 
when the patient‘s APV episode began.  Use the date and time when the admission to the hospital occurs.  Enter the following statement in the administrative section of the cover 
sheet ―Patient admitted from APU.  Information on the APV procedure is maintained in the APV record.‖ 
5.40.6.3.  Do not combine the original APV documentation with the inpatient record but maintain it separately in the EAR folder. 
5.40.6.4.  Include copies of the ADM Patient Encounter Form or automated cover sheet, the   abbreviated   history   and   physical,   operative   report,   and   any   other   pertinent 
documentation in the inpatient record, as applicable. 5.40.6.5.  Code the inpatient record with the reason that caused the admission. 
5.41.  Creating, Coding, and Documenting Observation Records. 5.41.1.  Observation  patients  are  outpatients  with  acute  or  chronic  medical  problems  who 
require   assessment   monitoring   or   diagnostic   evaluation   in   order   to   determine   final disposition.    The  decision  to  place  a  patient  in  observation  status  is  based  upon  the 
complexity, intensity, and duration of care required. 5.41.2.  Outpatient  observation  stays  generally  should  not  exceed  23  hours  and  59  minutes.  
However,  up  to  48  hours  may  be  authorized  when  medical  necessity  has  been  clearly demonstrated. 
5.41.3.  Observation patients may be cared for in either dedicated observation units or in any designated bed space.  Appropriate Joint Commission and/or AAAHC standards will apply.

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   301  
5.41.4.  Documentation of Observation Records. 5.41.4.1.  Documentation for an observation patient must meet the standards for a short-
term   stay   (abbreviated   medical   record)   and   must   comply   with   the   current   Joint Commission and/or AAAHC documentation standards. 
5.41.4.2.  Standard  Forms  (SF),  or  other  forms  as  noted,  are  recommended  for  use  in observation  records.    At  a  minimum,  the  documentation  in  the  medical  record  will 
include: 5.41.4.2.1.  Summary of pertinent diagnostic findings. 
5.41.4.2.2.  A plan of care to include reasons for observation, diagnoses, and risks of complication, patient education, release instructions, medication orders, and plans for 
follow-up care. 5.41.4.2.3.  SF 558. 
5.41.4.2.4.  SF 509. 5.41.4.2.5.  All  diagnostic  reports  (e.g.,  laboratory,  radiology,  or  electrocardiogram) 
as applicable. 5.41.4.2.6.  AF Form 3066 or 3066-1. 
5.41.4.2.7.  AF Form 3069 as applicable. 5.41.4.2.8.  AF Form 3068 as applicable. 
5.41.4.2.9.  AF Form 3067 as applicable. 5.41.4.2.10.  Advance Directive (if previously accomplished by the patient). 
5.41.4.3.  File all documentation related to an observation stay in the EAR folder. 5.41.4.4.  Forward the  following  documents  to  the  outpatient  treatment  record:  release 
note  with  summary  of  pertinent  diagnostic  findings,  status  of  patient  upon  release,  and release instructions with plans for follow-up care. 
5.41.5.  Coding of Observation Records. 5.41.5.1.  Code   diagnoses   according   to   the   current   version   of   the   International 
Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD)  coding  references  or  current  government  approved coding classification system. 
5.41.5.2.  Code  procedures/operations  according to  the  Current  Procedure  Terminology (CPT) coding references or current government approved coding classification system. 
5.41.5.3.  Utilize  the  Ambulatory  Data  Module  (ADM)  in  CHCS  to  capture  the  coded information on each observation episode, except when an observation patient is admitted. 
5.41.6.  Admission of Observation Patients.  When a patient is admitted from an observation status,  file  the  observation  documentation  in  the  EAR  folder.    Place  copies  of  pertinent 
documentation in the inpatient record. 5.42.  Patients  Discharged  Without  Definitive  Diagnosis.  The  inpatient  records  department 
maintains  in  a  suspense  file,  records  that  the  provider  has  indicated  should  be  held  pending pathology reports, laboratory test results, or other confirmations.  Never maintain the records in 
----------------Page (300) Break----------------
  302  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
suspense longer than one month after the month of disposition.  Process the record with whatever information is available.  The record may be corrected at a later date if information, which alters 
the final diagnosis, is received. 5.43.  Disposition of Inpatient Records. 
5.43.1.  When transferring patients to another MTF, send a complete and legible copy of the current  inpatient  record,  original  outpatient  record,  and  copies  of  any  previous  admissions 
pertinent to the patient‘s current condition.  If complete and legible copies cannot be made in time  for  the  patient‘s  transfer,  send  the  original  current  inpatient  record.   Note:  The 
receiving MTF returns original records to the transferring MTF when they have served their purpose.    Also,  send  any  x-ray  films  and  duplicate  slides  or  surgical  specimens  when  the 
findings have a direct bearing on the diagnosis and treatment. 5.43.2.  The  admitting  facility  notifies  the  originating MTF  of  patients  admitted  while  on 
directed convalescence, PCS home, or AWOL from another medical facility while in patient status.  If the patient will remain at the new MTF, the initial facility transfers the individual 
to the new MTF and forwards the patient‘s records. 5.43.3.  When  transferring  patients  to  non-military  MTFs,  a  transcript  or  copy  of  pertinent 
pages may accompany the patient.  Never release the original records; however, pertinent x-ray films are furnished to the receiving non-military MTF as required. 
5.43.4.  Send a copy of the current inpatient record and any x-ray films when an active duty patient is transferred to  a VA hospital pending separation or retirement from the uniformed 
services. 5.43.5.  Forward  original  records  of  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  military 
personnel and their family members (including x-ray film and medical examination reports) in a sealed envelope with the individual concerned upon transfer to another MTF.  When the 
individual is discharged, return the record to the  parent  country.   Retain copies of pertinent records necessary for quality assurance review. 
5.43.6.  Handle inpatient records of non-NATO military personnel and their family members the same as any other inpatient record. 
5.43.7.  When mailing records pertinent to litigation cases, mail medical records and  claims files via certified mail/return receipt. 
5.44.  Medical Transcription. 5.44.1.  Responsibilities  of  Medical  Transcription:  Medical  transcription  services  provide 
timely and accurate transcription of provider dictation dealing with inpatient and ambulatory patient  care.    It  is  a  patient  administration  responsibility  and  is  usually  managed  by  the 
inpatient medical records department supervisor in cooperation with the transcription quality assurance evaluator (QAE) and/or contracting officer‘s technical representative (COTR). 
5.44.2.  Production  Goals:    Each  medical  transcription  center  should  produce  an  acceptable quantity  and  quality  of  medical  transcription  in  a  timely  manner.    Normally,  these  services 
are employed to generate transcription services for inpatient episodes of care.  If transcription staffing and inpatient workload allow, transcription services can be expanded to ambulatory 
and  outpatient  clinic  services.    Inpatient  and  Ambulatory  Procedure  Visit  (APVs)  dictated operative reports must be transcribed and filed in the medical record immediately following 
----------------Page (301) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   303  
surgery.    MTFs  need  to  generate  clear  policy/guidance to  all  providers  in  their  facility regarding the scope of medical transcription services they intend to offer in accordance with 
the Joint Commission. 5.44.2.1.  Quantity:  Suggested production goals for medical transcriptionist are 800 lines 
per day  per  transcriptionist.    The  senior  transcriptionist  or  supervisor,  in  a  smaller medical  transcription  center,  contributes  to  the work  center  output,  however, their  goals 
are  lower  than  those  established  for  other  medical  transcriptionists  and  decrease  as  the size   of   the   medical   transcription   center   and   supervisory   responsibilities   increase.  
Personnel in training should be able to achieve the production goals within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 1 year. 
5.44.2.2.  Counting  and  Reporting:    Medical  transcriptionists  count  and  record  their output according to the following suggested instructions. (Output is reported daily to the 
senior transcriber or supervisor.) 5.44.2.2.1.  Margins  should  be  adjusted  to  ensure  full  lines  that  average  80  strokes. 
Narrative lines of 80 strokes should average 13 words.  Count each typed line with six words or more as a line; any narrative line with five words or less is not counted. 
5.44.2.2.2.  Form-style typing: 5.44.2.2.2.1.  Count each line with two or more names, dates or words as one line. 
5.44.2.2.2.2.  Physician signature elements are  counted as two lines when a two-line signature element is used, and counted as one line when a one-line signature 
element is used. 5.44.2.2.2.3.  Patient identification data is counted as two lines. 
5.44.2.2.3.  The  senior  transcriptionist  or  supervisor  reports  individual  production  to the supervisor or QAE/COTR of inpatient records. 
5.44.2.3.  The   supervisor   or   QAE/COTR   of   inpatient   records,   through   the   senior transcriptionist  or  supervisor,  monitors  the  quality  of  all  medical  transcription.  When 
medical  transcriptionists  are  required  to  retype  work  which  does  not  meet  quality standards, do not include lines retyped in production counts. 
5.44.2.4.  Work  should  normally  be  completed  within  24  hours  of  receipt  of  dictation.  Transcribed  narrative  summaries  and  operative  reports  should  be  filed  in  the  medical 
record  prior  to  inpatient/APV  coding  to  provide  complete  documentation  and  ensure accurate coding. 
Section 5D—Deployed Assignment Medical Record Management 
5.45.  Minimum     Deployed     Medical     Documentation     and     Record     Management Requirements. 
5.45.1.  The  DD  Form  2766,  Adult  Preventive  and  Chronic  Care  Flowsheet  is  the  principle folder used to document primary medical and dental care for active duty, Air Force Reserve, 
Air   National   Guard,   and   deployable   federal   civilian   employees   while   in   a   deployed environment.    Inpatient  documents  generated  from  a  theater  MTF  will  likely  be  maintained 
and documented separately from the medical information stored in the DD Form 2766. 
----------------Page (302) Break----------------
  304  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.45.2.  Health  records  located  at  deployed  combat  theater  locations  are  maintained  by  unit medical  personnel.   Deployed  medical  Commanders  will  ensure  effective  re-deployment 
medical   out-processing   procedures   are   in   place,   and   will   work   with   deployed   unit commanders  to  ensure  required  actions  are  completed  for  all  re-deploying  personnel,  to 
include all DoD uniformed members, civilians, and contractors IAW DoDI 6490.03. 5.45.3.  Deployed  medical  unit  records  managers  will  use  the  cardstock  DD  Form  2766  to 
document primary medical and dental care.  The DD Form 2766 typically contains the same types  of  outpatient  medical  and  dental  forms  that  would  normally  be  generated  back  at  the 
Service Member‘s host MTF/DTF.  Deployed records personnel are required to file all primary  local,  Service-specific,  Standard,  and  Optional  forms  generated  from  primary  care 
provider-patient  encounters,  into  the  cardstock  DD  Form  2766.    File  documents  inside  the cardstock DD Form 2766 in chronological order, with the most recent encounter filed on top 
of older documents. 5.45.4.  Theater  Electronic  Health  Record(s)  and/or  Applications:    Although  advances  in 
electronic  medical  record  technology  support  comprehensive  regional  healthcare  operations in the deployment environment, unless the medical information maintained in these systems 
can  provide  reliable,  secure,  and  timely  medical  record  data  transfer  from  the  deployed medical unit to the DoD‘s Central Data Repository, deployed medical records personnel are 
required  to  print  each  primary  care  patient  encounter  and  file  the  printed  form  into  the cardstock DD Form 2766. 
5.45.5.  Documenting   Patient   Care:   Proper   documentation   of   medical/surgical   care   is accomplished on  all patients treated at the EMEDS/Air Force Theater Hospital.  Utilization 
of the SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care, is the primary form used to document most  ambulatory  care.    AF  Form  3909,  Critical  Care  Flow  Sheet  is  used  to  record  critical 
care patients‘ treatment/progress.  All ambulatory care healthcare forms and documents must be  filed  into  the  DD  Form  2766.    The  outpatient  healthcare  information  collected  on  these 
forms must return to the member‘s host MTF. 5.45.5.1.  For  patients  entering  the  aeromedical  evacuation  system,  the  AF  Form  3830, 
Patient Manifest (5 copies minimum) should be completed for each AE mission.   If not available, substitute this form with the DD Form 601, Patient Evacuation Manifest.  The 
AF  Form  3899,  AE  Patient  Record,  accompanies  the  patient  to  ensure  appropriate  care during transport.  This document is primarily used to direct and record en route care.  If 
AF  Form  3899  is  not  available,  use  DD  Form  602,  Patient  Evacuation  Tag.    Medical orders should be clearly written on either the AF Form 3899 or the DD Form 1380, U.S. 
Field  Medical  Tag.    The  DD  Form  1380  normally  is  used  by  the  originating  facility during  contingencies.    The  information  on  the  DD  Form  1380  is  transcribed  to  the  AF 
Form  3899/DD  Form  602  upon  entry  into  the  AE  System.    Information  should  include both  primary  and  secondary  diagnoses,  correct  patient  classification,  and  orders  for  all 
enroute medications, care, and special diets.  A concise, pertinent nursing note from the referral MTF should be written on the form as a transfer note.  At a minimum, the note 
should  include  the  dates  and  times  of  last  medications,  vital  signs,  and  treatment rendered. The  employment  of  the  CHCS  or  other  electronic  medical  record  systems  is 
desired for inpatient management. 
----------------Page (303) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   305  
5.45.5.2.  Required  deployed  healthcare  minimum  documentation  forms  include:  SF Form  600,  Chronological  Record  of  Medical  Care;  DD  Form  1380,  US  Field  Medical

5.45.6.  Deployed MTF medical staff will: 5.45.6.1.  Work  with  the  deployed  MPS  and  unit  commanders to  ensure  all  returning  or 
re-deploying personnel are identified in a timely manner and have completed medical re-deployment   screening   and/or   out-processing   no   earlier   than   30   days   prior   to 
scheduled/projected departure. 5.45.6.2.  Interview returning or re-deploying members, and for each: 
5.45.6.2.1.  Ensure Service  Members  complete  the  automated  DD  Form  2796,  Post-Deployment  Health  Assessment,  via  electronic  process  using  Aeromedical  Services 
Information  Management  System  (ASIMS) Web  (hard  copies  will  not  be  accepted).  Following the member‘s completion of the electronic DD 2796, a MTF provider must 
interview  the  member  face-to-face  and  electronically  sign  the  DD  2796  in  ASIMS Web.  Once the DD 2796 has been electronically signed by the provider and closed in 
ASIMS   Web,   it   will   be   automatically   transmitted   via the   Defense   Medical Surveillance System. 
5.45.6.2.2.  After  the  patient  and  MTF  provider  have  completed  the  electronic  DD 2796 in ASIMS Web, MTF medical personnel are required to print a hard copy of the 
electronic  DD  2796  and  place  it  in  the  member‘s deployment medical record (DD 2766).  The form must contain a provider‘s signature, date and time stamp.  If the 
Service  Member  is  unable  to  complete  the  form  electronically  due  to  computer failure, network interruption, or the unavailability of an automated process, deployed 
medical staff must prominently place the following notice in the DD 2766,; ―Member unable  to  Electronically  Complete  DD  2796  in  Theater.    Member  must  report  to 
Public Health within 5 duty days of returning to home unit to complete the electronic DD 2796.‖ 
5.45.7.  The deployed healthcare provider will: 5.45.7.1.  Reviews  the  completed  DD  2796  and  deployed  health  record  with  member 
during a face-to-face encounter, and in so doing: 5.45.7.1.1.  Address  all  positive  responses  entered  by  member  on  the  DD  2796.  
Discuss    any    member    concerns    relating    to    mental    health    issues,    potential environmental/occupational   exposures,   or   special   medications   taken   during   the 
deployment. 5.45.7.1.2.  Document  any  Force  Health  Protection  Prescription  Products  (i.e.,  anti-
malarial,  P-tabs,  Atropine,  2-PAM  Chloride  or  CANA)  that  the  member ingested  or introduced into his/her body during the deployment.  The provider must annotate any 
related adverse events, and advises member on required follow-up actions. 
----------------Page (304) Break----------------
  306  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
5.45.7.1.3.  Arrange  for  further  medical  evaluation  or  follow-up  in  theater  (within existing capabilities) or annotate the need for evaluation on return to home station. 
5.45.7.1.4.  The healthcare provider shall also sign and stamp (signature block/name) each departing member‘s hard copy DD Form 2796. 
5.45.8.  Deployed MTF support (records) staff will: 5.45.8.1.  File  the  signed/stamped  hard  copy  DD  Form  2796  into  the  DD  Form  2766, 
Deployed  Health  Record,  for  later  placement  in  the  permanent  medical  record  by  host station MTF personnel. 
5.45.8.2.  Package  and  seal  the  medical  records  for  each  returning  Service  Member.  Individual records may be bundled together (but not inter-filed) and sealed together in a 
bulk  courier package.    Identify  the troop  commander for  each  returning  or  re-deploying group  and  transfer  the  sealed  medical  records  to  him  or  her.    If  no  troop  commander 
exists,  identify  the  senior  ranking  member  in  the  group  and  transfer  the  records  to him/her,  or  his/her  authorized  delegate.    Obtain  a  chain  of  custody  receipt  before 
completing the transfer.  If records are to be packaged and sealed for a single returning or re-deploying  Service  Member,  first  check  with  a  mental  health  provider  to  ensure  the 
Service Member should not be physically or mentally harmed if he or she were to open the sealed package and read the documents inside.  If the mental health provider decides 
the  sealed  medical  documents  for  a  returning  or  re-deploying  Service  Member  could potentially cause the member harm if he or she were to read the documents, contact the 
Service Member‘s host MTF and arrange for the records to be mailed back to the medical unit.  If the mailing option is used, ensure the package is mailed with a package-tracking 
or return-receipt confirmation service (if available). 5.45.8.3.  Each  DD  Form  2766  should  contain  all  primary  care  medical  documents 
generated  during  the  length  of  the  deployment.    The  minimum  number  and  name  of documents to be filed into each DD Form 2766 include: 
5.45.8.3.1.  Smallpox vaccination screening forms (SF 600 Overprint). 5.45.8.3.2.  All   primary   care   patient   documents   (if   no   automated   data   transfer 
mechanism  exists  that  guarantees  reliable,  secure,  and  timely  medical  record  data transfer from the deployed location to DoD‘s Central Data Repository, print each 
primary care patient encounter and file the printed form into the cardstock DD Form 2766). 
5.45.8.3.3.  Environmental/Occupational Health Exposure Data (SF 600 Overprint). 5.45.8.3.4.  Physical therapy and dental visit records. 
5.45.8.3.5.  Mental  health  provider  documentation:    (Note:  If  a  mental  health provider  decides  that  sealed  medical  documents  for  a  returning  or  re-deploying 
Service Member could potentially  cause the member harm if he or she were to  read the documents, contact the Service Member‘s host MTF and arrange for the records 
to be mailed back to the medical unit). 5.45.8.3.6.  Provider signed, dated, and ID stamped DD Form 2796.

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   307  
5.45.8.3.7.  Insert  a  shipping  roster  of  names  and  ranks  for  each  corresponding  DD Form  2766  placed  inside  each  bulk  courier  package.    Label  individual  sealed 
envelopes  with  the  returning  or  re-deploying member‘s name, rank, home unit, and assignment  installation.    For  bulk  courier  and  individual  medical  record  packages, 
address  the  outside  envelope  or  package  with  the  following  pre-printed  or  stamped message,  ―PROTECTED  HEALTH  INFORMATION  ENCLOSED.    THIS 
ENVELOPE     MUST     BE     DELIVERED     TO     THE     FORCE     HEALTH MANAGEMENT OFFICE AT YOUR HOME DUTY STATION.‖ 
5.46.  Expeditionary Electronic Health Record Management Platforms and Systems. 5.46.1.  Joint-Theater  Trauma  Registry  (JTTR).    The  JTTR  system is  a  data  repository  that 
captures the information pertinent to the personal circumstances, clinical care and short and long-term outcomes of individuals subject to traumatic injury in the deployed environment. 
5.46.1.1.  The JTTR application is used to capture data from non-integrated clinical and administrative  systems  within  the  DoD  Military  Health  System.    The  Trauma  Registry 
Coordinators ensure that critical clinical data is collected in theater and incorporated into the  JTTR  to  provide  a  comprehensive  picture  of  trauma  patients  from  point  of  injury 
through rehabilitation.  Data should reflect all care given to victims of trauma at all levels of care.  Referrals at all levels and for all purposes should be captured by the system. 
5.46.1.2.  Since  its  implementation,  the  JTTR  has  created  and  maintained  thousands  of electronic  health  records  of  battle  and  non-battle  injuries  of  US,  Allied  and  enemy 
combatants.    The  system  also  provides  a  full-range  of  critical  data  regarding  personal protective equipment effectiveness and durability to engineer better protective equipment 
to safeguard service members from explosions.  As the Theater Trauma System matures, JTTR data will be used to improve the overall quality of care provided to injured Airmen, 
Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines. 5.46.2.  TRANSCOM  (Transportation  Command)  Regulating  and  Command  &  Control 
Evacuation System (TRAC2ES). TRAC2ES is a medical regulating, medical asset tracking, and in-transit visibility (ITV) patient movement system.  It combines transportation, logistics, 
and   clinical   decision   elements   into   a   seamless   information   system   that   prioritizes requirements,  assigns  proper  resources,  and  distributes  relevant  data  to  efficiently  deliver 
patients.    TRAC2ES  is  sponsored  and  maintained  by  the  United  States  Transportation Command.    It  is  a  Joint,  unclassified  and  classified  system  that  is  also  used  by  the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Coalition military members to coordinate and track the  movement  of  patients  and  their  attendants  throughout  the  entire  patient  movement 
process, during war, peace, and contingency operations worldwide.  For deployed sites with limited or no web access, TRAC2ES has a ―store and forward‖ client-based  application.  
Information  captured  by the  system  also  provides  DoD  with  critical  data  used  for  medical and disease trending and operational planning. TRAC2ES provides support for multi-modal, 
military  and  commercial  patient  transportation.  See  AFI  41-301  and  DoDI  6000.11,  Patient Movement for instruction on AE operations. 
5.46.3.  Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP). The TMIP is a family of systems that includes  a  variety  of  modular  and  scalable  information  management  and  information 
technology  solutions,  which  together  extend  the military‘s home-based  electronic  health record  capabilities  to  the  Theater  of  Operations.  TMIP  enables  complete  clinical  care

documentation,  medical  supply  and  equipment  tracking,  patient  movement  visibility  and health surveillance in Theater environments. 
5.46.4.  Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS). TMDS is part of TMIP‘s integrated suite of deployed   solutions   and   serves   as   the   authoritative   Theater   database   for   collecting, 
distributing  and  viewing  Service  Members'  pertinent  medical  information.  It  provides  one central  location  for  healthcare  providers  to  view  Theater  medical  data.  TMDS  views  and 
tracks ill or injured patients as they move through the Theater levels of care, Sustaining Base MTFs  and  those  shared  with  the  VA.  TMDS  updates  the  AHLTA CDR,  where  all  Service 
Members'  Electronic  Health  Records  reside.  This  information  is  also  made  available  to  the VA  through  an  interface  known  as  Bidirectional  Health  Information  Exchange-Theater 
(BHIE-T).  Using  TMDS,  medical  staff  can  view  an  airlifted  critically  injured  patient‘s history,  progress  notes,  laboratory,  drug  and  radiological  history  before  arrival  at  their next 
location.  TMDS  supports  the  collection  of  information  from  first  responder,  battalion  aid station  and  Theater  hospitals  and  makes  the information  readable  in  Theater  and  back  to 
OCONUS and CONUS hospitals and ultimately to the CDR and to the VA. 5.46.5.  Medical  Communications  for  Combat  Casualty  Care  (MC4).  Deployable  medical 
forces  use  the  MC4  system  to  gain  quick,  accurate  access  to  patient  histories  and  forward casualty  resuscitation  information.  The  system  also  provides  units  with  automated  tools 
facilitating  patient  tracking,  medical  reporting  and  medical  logistical  support.  Combatant commanders  use  the  MC4  system  to  access medical  surveillance  information,  resulting  in 
enhanced medical situational awareness.

Chapter 6 
HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
Section 6A—Air Force Program Overview 
6.1.  HIPAA  within  the  Air  Force  Medical Service.  The  purpose  of  the  Health  Insurance Portability  and  Accountability  Act  is  to  improve  the  portability  and  continuity  of  health 
insurance coverage, improve access to long term care services and coverage, and to simplify the administration  of  healthcare.    A  primary  component  of  HIPAA  administrative  simplification 
provisions  is  the  protection  and  privacy  of  individually  identifiable  health  information.    The HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  governs  this  component,  and  DoD  6025.18-R,  DoD  Health  Information 
Privacy Regulation  implements  the  requirements  of  the  HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  throughout  the MHS. 
6.1.1.  Department  of  Defense  Regulation,  8580.02-R,  DoD  Health  Information  Security, implements  the  requirements  of  the  HIPAA  Security  Rule  throughout  the  MHS.   The  Air 
Force  Medical  Service  furthers  implements  the  HIPAA  Security  Rule  through  AFI  41-217, Health  Information  Assurance  For  Military  Treatment  Facilities.    These  instructions  should 
be  referenced  as  necessary  to  ensure  full  integration  of  HIPAA  Privacy and  Security activities. 
6.2.  Interaction  Between  HIPAA  Privacy  and  Patient  Administration  Functions.  Many of the  HIPAA  Privacy  implementation  requirements  set  forth  by  DoD  6025.18-R  are  functions 
inherently  conducted  by  TRICARE  Operations  and  Patient  Administration  (TOPA)  personnel within the MTF.  As such, guidance regarding HIPAA matters can be found throughout various 
sections of AFI 41-210; the purpose of this chapter is to address topics not otherwise referenced in this instruction, or requiring additional emphasis. 
Section 6B—HIPAA Administration 
6.3.  Organizational Structure and Functional Responsibilities. 6.3.1.  The  Air  Force  Medical  Support  Agency  (AFMSA).    AFMSA  will  appoint  an  Air 
Force Medical Service (AFMS) HIPAA Privacy Officer (HPO).  The primary responsibility of the AFMS HPO is to oversee policy development and interpretation as necessary to ensure 
AFMS  compliance  with  applicable  federal  guidelines,  Department  of  Health  and  Human Services  (HHS)  rules,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  directives  and  instructions,  and  Air 
Force (AF) policies and procedures pertaining to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individual‘s health information subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Additionally, the 
AFMS  HPO  provides  HIPAA  privacy  support  and  subject  matter  expertise  to  all  AF/SG directorates assigned to the National Capitol Region (NCR). 
6.3.1.1.  Communicates   and   coordinates   with   the   TRICARE   Management   Activity (TMA),  external  federal  agencies,  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF)  agencies,  and 
other DoD organizations as necessary to implement, clarify and execute HIPAA privacy activities throughout the Air Force Medical Service.

6.3.1.2.  Provides policy guidance to Air Force Medical Ooperations Agency (AFMOA), Health  Benefits  Support  Branch  on  a  regular  and  as  needed  basis  to  ensure  MTFs  are 
receiving current and accurate information regarding HIPAA privacy policy, procedures and operational changes. 
6.3.1.3.  The  Air  Force  HPO, in  collaboration  with  AFMOA,  will  create  and  distribute Privacy Officer training for MTF Privacy Officers.  The AF HPO will ensure AF/SG and 
directorate  personnel  assigned  to  the NCR  receive  initial  and  annual  HIPAA  training  in accordance with AFMS and HIPAA policy and procedures. 
6.3.2.  Air   Force   Medical   Operations   Agency   (AFMOA).         Will   provide   centralized capability  and  lead  the  AFMS  in  executing  all  HIPAA  and  Privacy  Act  (PA)  policies  and 
prepare  for, respond  to,  and  mitigate  the effects  of  breaches  of  PHI.  AFMOA  will  provide privacy  and  security  consultation  to  support  the  AF  medical  infrastructure.    The  Chief, 
Health  Benefits  Support  will  ensure  AFMOA  and  MAJCOM/SG  personnel  are  trained  in accordance with AFMS and HIPAA policy and procedures. 
6.3.2.1.  HIPAA  and  Privacy  Act  execution  functions  will  be  centralized  at  AFMOA within  the  SGA  Directorate,  Health  Benefits  Support.      AFMOA  will  appoint  an 
individual  to  serve  as  the  single  point  of  contact  to  funnel  privacy  and  security information between AFMSA and the field. This branch will oversee HIPAA privacy and 
security functions and will be responsible to monitor AFMS HIPAA compliance, provide centralized technical expertise, conduct site visits, and provide consultative assistance to 
MAJCOM Surgeons and MTFs. 6.3.3.  Medical  Group  Commander.    The  Medical  Group  Commander  (Medical  Treatment 
Facility (MTF) Commander) will maintain overall responsibility for the implementation and administration  of  local  MTF  HIPAA  privacy  and  security  programs  designed  to  ensure 
compliance with established federal, DoD, and Air Force privacy and confidentiality rules. 6.3.3.1.  Ensures  comprehensive  Medical  Group  Instructions  (MDGIs)  are  developed  to 
integrate  all  documentation  requirements and  implementation  specifications  of  DoD 6025.18-R and this instruction into local business practices. 
6.3.3.2.  Designates,  in  writing,  a  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  (HPO)  to  implement  and manage HIPAA Privacy compliance activities throughout the MTF‘s facilities,  and  to 
receive  and  investigate  complaints  and  allegations  of  non-compliance  with  the  HIPAA Privacy Rule. 
6.4.  MTF HIPAA Privacy Officer (HPO). 6.4.1.  Oversees  all  ongoing  activities  related  to  the  development,  implementation,  and 
maintenance of MTF policies and procedures covering the access to [and privacy of] patient health  information.    The  HPO  ensures  adherence  to  the  MHS  policies  and  procedures 
covering  these  same  areas.  The  HPO  ensures  MTF  compliance  with  federal  laws  and regulations, and with the healthcare organization‘s information privacy practices.  He or she 
leads  initiatives  to  strengthen  patient  information  privacy  protections.    Many  activities required by HIPAA privacy overlap with patient administration duties and require interaction 
with  senior  level  personnel  and  coordination  with  external  agencies.    Therefore,  it  is appropriate  to  appoint  the  TOPA  Flight  Chief,  Patient  Administration  Officer,  TOPA  or 
Patient  Administration  Director,  Flight  Superintendent  or  NCOIC  or  other  individual  with 
----------------Page (309) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   311

6.4.2.  Develops  policies  and  procedures  for  local  implementation  of  the  DoD  HIPAA Privacy   regulation   as   described   in   paragraph   6.3.3.1. Note: many   implementation 
requirements required by DoD 6025.18-R may already be addressed in other MDGIs such as Patient   Administration   Functions,   Medical   Record   Administration,   and   Information 
Assurance guidelines.  In these cases the HPO should coordinate with the appropriate office to  validate  existing  instructions  adequately  address  DoD  6025.18-R  requirements,  and  may 
then  simply  cross-reference  the  policy  rather  than  duplicate  policies  in  a  separate  HIPAA instruction. 
6.4.3.  Ensures  the  delivery  of  initial  and  refresher  privacy  training  to  all  members  of  the MTF workforce, including volunteers, medical and professional staff, physician residents and

6.4.12.4.  Coordinates   with   HIPAA   Security   Officer   to   review   all   system-related information  security  plans  throughout  the  MTF  network  to  ensure  alignment  between 
security and privacy practices and act as a liaison to the information systems department. 6.4.12.5.  Collaborates  with  HIPAA  Security  Officer  to  ensure  appropriate  security 
measures are in place to safeguard PHI. 6.4.12.6.  Conducts  an  initial  compliance  assessment  within  60  days  of  assignment  and 
documents findings  in  the  AFMS  approved  compliance  monitoring  tool.  Conducts periodic  compliance  monitoring  per  AFMS  policy  guidance,  identifies  shortfalls  in 
compliance  and  implements  corrective  action(s)  as  necessary;  documents  results  using the AFMS approved compliance monitoring tool. 
6.4.12.7.  Provides  a  briefing  on  patient  rights  and  provides  the MHS  Notice  of  Privacy Practices (NoPP) at all Wing Newcomer‘s Orientations briefings as part of the TOPA 
Flight briefing. 
Section 6C—Providing Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP) 
6.5.  NoPP  Requirements.  The  AFMS  utilizes  the  Military  Health  System  (MHS)  Notice  of Privacy Practices  (NoPP), which explains how the patient's PHI may be used and disclosed.   It 
also  describes  the  patient's  rights  regarding  the  use  of  PHI  and  contact  information  for complaints or issues.  Each MTF must have procedures established to meet all the administrative 
elements found in the Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP). 6.5.1.  In  instances  where  the  MTF  has a  Direct  Treatment  Relationship  with  a  patient,  the 
MTF must make a good faith attempt to ensure the patient has received the MHS Notice of Privacy  Practices  and  obtain  a  written acknowledgement  of  receipt.    The  patient,  parent,  or 
guardian must be asked to sign the acknowledgement of their receipt of a copy of the NoPP located  on  the  back-side  (exterior)  of  the  outpatient  medical  or  dental  record. Note: 
Acknowledgement   was   previously   required   on   both   the   medical   and   dental   record.  Redundant acknowledgement is not required if local procedures  are in place allowing MTF 
personnel  to  validate an  acknowledgement  is  on  file.   If the NoPP  acknowledgement  is  not found, then affix a NoPP label with the required information to the back-side (exterior) of the 
outpatient  medical  or dental  medical  record.    The  label  should  be  centered  and  placed  near the  bottom  of  the  exterior  of  the  record  jacket.    If  an  individual  refuses  to  sign  the  NoPP 
label, then the refusal must be annotated by MTF staff on the NoPP label. 
----------------Page (311) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   313  
6.5.1.1.  MTFs that retrieve or ―pull‖ records only by exception for outpatient visits must have a process in place to ensure the beneficiary  has acknowledged receipt of the MHS 
NoPP. 6.5.1.2.  Future  technological  updates  to  AHLTA  may  automate  the  NoPP  process  and 
afford  the  capability  of  capturing  a  patient's  signature  electronically.    Once  deployed, facilities with this ability may use this system to obtain beneficiary acknowledgement of 
the  MHS  NoPP  in  lieu  of  obtaining  a  hard-copy  acknowledgement.  Use  of  electronic NoPP  capture  is  not  mandatory;  facilities  may  determine  the  most  efficient  method  of 
NoPP acknowledgement as appropriate to local business practices. 6.5.2.  Ensure  copies  of  the  MHS  NoPP  pamphlet  are  readily  available  throughout  MTF 
points  of  service  for  beneficiaries  to  review  and  take  with  them.    Additionally,  the  MHS NoPP  poster  must  be  prominently  displayed  in  locations  where  it  is  reasonable  to  expect 
patients  to  be  able  to  read  the  notice.    Ensure  the  MTF  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  contact information is provided on the poster in the lower right corner. 
6.5.3.  MTFs that maintain an official website describing customer services or benefits must prominently post the MHS Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP) on the website‘s home page. 
Section 6D—Accounting for Disclosures of Health Information 
6.6.  Accounting  of  Disclosures.  A  patient  may  request  an  accounting  of  every  disclosure  for the previous 6-year period.  This does not currently include uses of PHI for treatment, payment 
or healthcare operations.  These disclosure categories include:  information  about Decedents, As Required by Law,  To Avert Serious Threats to Health or Safety, Cadaver Organ, eye, or Tissue 
Donation  Purposes,  Health  Oversight  Activities,  Inmates  in  Correctional  Institutions  or  in Custody, Judicial and Administrative Proceedings, Law enforcement Purposes, Medical Facility 
Patient   Directories,   Public   Health   Activities,   Research   Purposes,   Specialized   Government Functions,  Victims of Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence, Workman‘s Compensation. For 
more detailed guidance, refer to DoD 6025.18-R, Chapter 7.    Refer to DoD 6025.18-R Chapter 13 for a listing of exceptions to accounting. 
6.6.1.  Disclosure  Accounting  Procedures:  The  HPO  will  establish  a  mechanism  that  tracks disclosures of PHI within the purview of organizational policy as required by law and allows 
qualified individuals to review or receive a report on such activity.  IAW DoD 6025.18-R, all MTFs will use a standardized tracking mechanism for accountable HIPAA disclosures.  The 
Protected  Health  Information  Management  Tool  (PHIMT)  is  the  preferred  method  to document all accountable disclosures.  If the MTF elects to use an alternative tool, it must be 
coordinated  through  the  AFMOA  HIPAA  team  and  approved  by  the  Air  Force  HIPAA Privacy  Officer  (AFMSA)  prior  to  implementation  to  ensure  compliance  with  statutory 
requirements.  At a minimum, this data must be centralized and the tool able to account for all   disclosures   made   throughout   the   MTF,   and   conform   to   all   privacy   and   security 
safeguards.  All  accountable  disclosures  must  be  kept  for  a  minimum  of  6  years  IAW  DoD 6025.18-R.    Refer  to  Chapter  13  in  DoD  6025.18-R  for  further  guidance  on  the  various 
categories of disclosures which must be documented.

Section 6E—Access to Armed Forces Personnel Health Records by Commander or Designee 
6.7.  Authorized  Access.  HIPAA allows for a specific military exception as governed by DoD 6025.18-R, C7.11 to ―assure the proper execution of the military mission.‖ 
6.7.1.  Access, however, must be balanced with the recognized sensitivity of medical records, which often contain information of a very private nature.  Therefore, before a commander or 
his/her designee gains access to an individual‘s PHI, he or she must establish the information is required for mission-related purposes IAW DoD 6025.18-R, C7.11.  In instances where the 
MTF   is   uncertain   if   the   commander   or   designee   has   established   a   need   for   the information the  HPO  shall  seek  the  advice  of  the  SJA  or  in-house  MLC,  who  in  turn will 
consult with the appropriate MLC.  Disclosure of PHI should be released IAW the Minimum Necessary Rule as defined in DoD 6025.18-R. 
6.7.1.1.  The MTF Commander or their designee may provide a summary of the pertinent health  information  to  the  requesting  Commander  or  designee   IAW   the  Minimum 
Necessary Rule.  Consent of the individual concerned in the review is not required. 6.7.1.2.  Access to the original record will be provided only if specifically requested for 
clarification  purposes  or  other  clear  need.    For  records  release  in  this  section,  the requester shall document in writing to the MTF Commander the need for the record and 
why  a  summary  per  paragraph  6.7.1.1.  is  not  sufficient.  The  review  of  said  records,  by command authority, shall be conducted with the assistance of a provider who can advise 
on medical record data that might otherwise be misinterpreted. 6.7.2.  Protected  Health  Information properly  disclosed  to  command  authorities  under  the 
provisions of DoD 6025.18-R, Chapter 7, remains subject to the Privacy Act as it is derived from a Privacy Act system of records.  The information in the commander‘s possession is no 
longer HIPAA-protected, as HIPAA only applies to covered entities. 6.7.3.  For release of information for PRP purposes, refer to the MTF Commander‘s role as 
described  in  DoD  Regulation  5210.42,  Nuclear  Weapons  Personnel  Reliability  Program (PRP)   and   AFMAN   10-3902,   same title.    Each  disclosure  of  the  patient‘s  medical 
information for PRP purposes must be accounted for. 6.8.  Commander Designee Process.  Verification of identity is required before releasing PHI to 
commanders  or  their  respective  designee  under the  provisions  of  DoD  6025.18-R.  The  MTF must  ensure  the  individual  to  whom  the  PHI  pertains  is  under  the  command  authority  of  the 
requestor, and that the information requested pertains to the military mission, fitness for duty, or other  permissible  disclosure.    The  following  safeguards  will  be  observed  to  ensure  these 
requirements are met: 6.8.1.  A commander is defined as an officer that has command authority over the individual 
as determined by the ―G-series‖ orders process.  Personnel permanently  assigned  to  the position   of   deputy/vice   commander   and   first   sergeant   are   designated   as   commander 
designees  by  virtue  of  their  position  and  do  not  require  an  appointment  letter.    Individuals filling  these  positions  on  a  temporary  or  interim  basis  must  be appointed  in  writing.  
Commanders will designate by name, in writing any additional personnel that are authorized to act on their behalf to receive PHI for assigned squadron personnel.  Designees should be 
----------------Page (313) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   315  
limited  in  number,  and  designee  letters  must  be  for  a  specified  period  of  time  and  for  a specified and directed purpose. 
6.8.2.  The   MTF   HPO   will   establish   procedures   for   communicating   with   local   units supported  by  the MTF  to  obtain  and  maintain  current  designee  listings  from  each  unit.  The 
HPO will provide MTF work centers with a current listing of designees for use in verifying the identity of commanders and their respective representatives. 
6.8.3.  The MTF HPO will establish procedures to ensure routine disclosures of PHI such as appointment rosters, PIMR reports, and quarters notifications are released only to authorized 
commanders or their respective designees and accounted for accordingly. 
Section 6F—Training 
6.9.  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  Oversight.  The  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  oversees,  directs,  and ensures delivery of HIPAA privacy/security training and orientation to all MTF employees and 
volunteers.    Upon  in-processing  to  the  organization,  employees  that  can  provide  proof  of completion of Air Force approved ―core‖ HIPAA training within the previous 12 months, need 
only  receive  local  facility  training.    Employees  that  cannot  offer  proof  of  completion  must complete both Air Force approved core HIPAA training and local facility training within 30 days 
of  assignment  or arrival.    Document  results  in  compliance  with  Air  Force  approved  training documentation  policies.    Ensure  annual  refresher  training  is  conducted  in  order  to  maintain 
workforce awareness and to introduce any changes to privacy policies. 6.9.1.  Delivery.    MHS-Learn  is  the  preferred  Air  Force  method  of  delivering  initial  and 
annual  core  HIPAA  training.    MTFs  may  request  use  of  alternative  delivery  methods  in instances  where  MHS-Learn is  determined  to  be  unusable due  to  connectivity  issues  which 
cannot be  resolved.  Use  of  alternative  delivery  methods  must  be  coordinated  through  the AFMOA  HIPAA  team  and  approved  by  the  Air  Force  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  at  AFMSA, 
prior to implementation to ensure compliance with core training content and documentation requirements.   AFMSA/SG3SA   will   provide   standardized   training   content   for   use   in 
delivering  core  training  content  to  those  facilities  that  are  approved  for  alternative  delivery methods.    Use  of  commercially  available  or  locally  produced  training  content  is  not 
authorized  to  meet  core  HIPAA  training  requirements.  Organizations  approved  for  use  of alternative delivery methods must maintain current and accurate records of initial and annual 
training  of  all  workforce  members  and  provide  training  statistics  to  AFMOA/SGAT  as requested.  MTFs requesting waiver consideration must submit the following information to 
AFMOA/SGAT  in  letter  format,  endorsed  by  the  MTF  Administrator  (SGA)  or  medical support squadron commander: 
6.9.1.1.  Identify the nature of the technical difficulties that prevent the MTF from using the MHS-Learn Platform. 
6.9.1.2.  Identify  the  specific  actions  that  have  been  taken  to  correct  problem  (e.g., contacting  Base  Communications  or  the  MHS-Learn  Help  Desk,  and/or  user  computer 
configuration attempts). 6.9.1.3.  Provide contact information for MTF MHS- Learn Administrator. 
6.9.2.  Ensure MTF specific HIPAA information (e.g., training on local policies, procedures, and  awareness  training)  is  briefed  at  MTF  in-processing  sessions, commander‘s calls and 
----------------Page (314) Break----------------
  316  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
other  venues  in  order  to  maintain  workforce  awareness  and  to  introduce  any  changes  to privacy   policies.   Ensure   that   MTF   staffers,   including   ADSMs,   RCSMs,   civil   service 
employees, contractors, residents, students, and volunteers receive HIPAA training. 6.9.3.  Initiate,  facilitate  and  promote  activities  to  foster  information  privacy  awareness 
within the organization and related entities. 6.9.4.  Other  audiences.    HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  or  medical  group  leadership will  provide 
general HIPAA overview training to new commanders and first sergeants within 90 days of assignment  using  the  standardized  AFMS  briefing  template.    Additional  briefings  may  be 
provided as needed or upon request of wing leadership. 
Section 6G—Complaints 
6.10.  Intake.  MTFs  must  establish  a  standard  procedure  to  receive  and  investigate  HIPAA-related  complaints  and  allegations  of  non-compliance.    The  MTF  may  elect  to  use  existing 
Patient Advocate services as a focal point for receiving complaints, or refer individuals directly to the MTF HPO. 
6.11.  Investigation.  In cases where the MTF Commander appoints an investigating officer, the MTF HPO will serve as an SME to the investigator; otherwise, the MTF HPO will investigate all 
HIPAA-related  complaints  and  prepare  a  written  report  of  the  investigation.    For  complaints involving e-PHI, the HPO will collaborate with the HIPAA Security Officer (HSO) to ensure an 
integrated  review  of  the  concern.    If  the  findings  of  the investigation  confirm  a  violation occurred, the HPO will recommend corrective actions to the MTF Commander.  The HPO will 
also  recommend  actions  to  mitigate,  to  the  extent  possible,  any  harmful  effect  of  a  confirmed violation. At a minimum, the report should contain the following information: 
6.11.1.  Name of the Complainant. 6.11.2.  Date the complaint was filed. 
6.11.3.  Date, time, and location of the incident. 6.11.4.  Name(s) and duty location(s) of any staff members who were involved. 
6.11.5.  Synopsis of the complaint. 6.11.6.  Results of the investigation. 
6.11.7.  Actions taken to resolve the complaint. 6.12.  Reporting.  The  HPO  will  respond  to  the  complainant  in  writing  regarding resolution  of 
the  complaint  in  accordance  with  local  Patient  Advocate  guidance,  but  not  later  than  30  days from receipt of the complaint.  Complainants will also be advised if the investigation determines 
that personally identifiable information was, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person for fraudulent purposes.  Refer to DoD 5400.11-R and Attachment 20 for 
further guidance on patient notification in these instances. 6.13.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) inquiries.  These are high-visibility, 
time sensitive issues. Complaints received at HHS are forwarded to the TMA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office for dissemination to the appropriate service-level Privacy Officer. See paragraph 
6.13.2. for guidance in situations where HHS sends the inquiry directly to the MTF.

AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   317  
6.13.1.  Procedures for processing HHS inquiries. 6.13.1.1.  Upon receiving a notification of inquiry the AFMS HIPAA Privacy Officer will 
prepare a cover letter to inform the appropriate MTF Commander of the inquiry; the letter will  include  guidance  regarding  investigation  and  documentation  requirements,  and 
establish  a  suspense  date  for  returning  the  completed  investigation  to  AFMSA/SG3SA.  The   cover   letter   will   be   packaged   with   the   HHS   inquiry   and   forwarded   to   the 
AFMOA/SGAT HIPAA Team for processing. AFMSA/SG3SA will maintain a log of all HHS inquiry actions and responses. 
6.13.1.2.  The AFMOA Health Benefits (AFMOA/SGAT) HIPAA team will forward the cover   letter and   inquiry   documentation   to   the   appropriate   MTF   Commander.  
Additionally,  the  team  will  provide  SME  assistance  to  MTF  personnel  as  necessary  in conducting  the  investigation  and  in  ensuring  a  comprehensive  response  is  prepared  for 
submission to HHS. 6.13.1.3.  Once   completed,   the   MTF   response   to   the   inquiry   and   all   required 
documentation will be submitted to the AFMOA/SGAT HIPAA team for quality review and submission to the AFMS HIPAA Privacy Officer.  The Privacy Officer will review 
and  approve  the report,  then  submit  to  the  TMA  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Office  for review and final processing. 
6.13.2.  The  MTF  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  must  immediately  notify  AFMOA/SGAT  in  the event  an  HHS  inquiry  bypasses  the  normal  routing  chain  and  is  received  directly  at  MTF-
level.    The  AFMOA/SGAT  HIPAA  team  will  ensure  appropriate  tracking  and  response procedures are initiated as described above; MTFs must not coordinate response submissions 
directly with HHS Field Representatives. 
Section 6H—Potential or Documented Compromise of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 
6.14.  Public Law 111-5.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009.  Title XIII of the act, also known as Health  Information 
Technology  for  Economic  and  Clinical  Health  Act  (HITECH),  implements  several  changes  to the  existing  HIPAA  Privacy  and  Security  Rules.    Among  these  changes  is  the  requirement  to 
notify  individuals,  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS),  and  the  media  of certain breaches of unsecured PHI. 
6.14.1.  As  an  entity  within  the  Federal  Government,  the  Air  Force  Medical  Service  is required to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 as implemented by AFI 33-332 as pertains 
to  safeguarding  and  reporting  breaches  of  PII.  Identifiable  medical  information  is  by definition PII, and therefore subject to the safeguards and reporting requirements identified in 
DoD  5400.11-R.    Additionally,  as  a  Covered  Entity  (CE)  subject  to  the  requirements  of HIPAA,  AFMS  medical  organizations  must  also  comply  with  DoD  6025.18-R  and  DoD 
8580.02-R. 6.14.2.  Compliance with HHS reporting requirements does not negate current DoD reporting 
requirements.      As   such,   AFMS   organizations   at   all   levels   must   ensure policies   and procedures  are  in  place  to  adhere  to  the  evaluation  and  reporting  criteria  of  both  DoD  and 
HHS requirements when reporting potential or verifiable breaches of PHI. 
----------------Page (316) Break----------------
  318  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
6.15.  Response  Action  Procedures.  Refer  to  Attachment  20  for  detailed  policy  guidance  and action  steps  all  MTFs  and  other  AFMS  organizations  must  adhere  to  in  ensuring  the  AFMS 
promotes a standardized and comprehensive approach to reporting breaches of information under our control. 
Section 6I—Use of e-mail to communicate Protected Health Information 
6.16.  Use  of  Electronic  Mail.  All  communications  of  PII,  which  includes  identifiable  health information, must be properly safeguarded in accordance with HIPAA and Air Force Messaging 
guidelines.    Use of  e-mail  to  transmit  PHI  is  only  authorized  For  Official  Use  Only  (FOUO) purposes and must comply with encryption and digital signature requirements of AFI 33-119, Air 
Force  Messaging  and  permissible  uses/disclosures  as  described  in  AFI  33-332  and  the  HIPAA privacy rule. 
6.16.1.  Patient  communications.  The  Corporate  Dental  Application  (CDA),  MiCare  secure messaging, and other AFMS approved secure messaging programs are authorized. The use of 
clinical  e-mail  between  MTF  personnel  and  a  beneficiary is  not  authorized  at  this  time. Common examples of clinical e-mails include, but are not limited to: 
6.16.1.1.  Communications of health information. 6.16.1.2.  Discussion of services and treatment options. 
6.16.1.3.  Providing healthcare consultation or advice. 6.16.1.4.  Coordinating prescription refills. 
6.16.1.5.  Scheduling appointments and referrals. 6.16.2.  Treatment, Payment, and Healthcare Operations (TPO). Use of e-mail between MTF 
personnel  for  treatment,  payment  and  healthcare  operations  functions  is  permissible  within the ―.mil‖ domain.  Under no circumstances will e-mail containing PHI be transmitted to an 
address outside the ―.mil‖ domain or to any address within the ―.mil‖ domain that is unable to receive  PKI  encrypted  messages.  This  includes  e-mail  messages  transmitted  via  the  PIMR 
system to appropriate command authorities; all messages must be properly encrypted prior to transmission. 
6.16.3.  Safeguards for transmitting FOUO e-mail include: 6.16.3.1.  Ensuring there is an official need to send the information before transmitting. 
6.16.3.2.  Confirming  all  recipients  are  authorized  to  receive  the  information  under  the Privacy Act and HIPAA. 
6.16.3.3.  Protecting the message from unauthorized disclosure, loss, or alteration through use of DoD PKI-based encryption. 
6.16.3.4.  Adding ―FOUO‖ to the beginning of the subject line, followed by the subject. Do NOT annotate any PHI in the subject line. 
6.16.3.5.  Inserting  the  following  statement  at  the  BEGINNING  of  the  e-mail  message:  ―FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.  This electronic transmission contains For Official Use 
Only (FOUO) information which must be protected by the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332 and  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  and  DoD  6025.18-R.  The 
----------------Page (317) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   319  
information   may   be   exempt   from   mandatory   disclosure   under   the   Freedom   of Information  Act,  5  U.S.C.  §  552.    If  you  have  received  this  message  in  error,  please 
notify the sender by reply e-mail and delete all copies of this message.‖ 6.16.3.6.  Double-checking all recipients‘ e-mail addresses before transmitting. 
6.16.3.7.  Do not indiscriminately use FOUO disclaimers or encryption on messages not warranting it. 
6.16.4.  E-mails containing PHI may be sent to organization/office symbol e-mail addresses (e.g.,  AFMOA/SGAT,  AFMSA/SG3SA)  and  must  comply  with  encryption  and  digital 
signature  requirements  of AFI  33-119  and  permissible  uses/disclosures  as  described  in  AFI 33-332   and   HIPAA   Privacy   and   Security   Rules.      Individuals   with   access   to   the 
organization/office  symbol  e-mailboxes  must  have  a  need  for  the information  as  the proper recipients   of   the   PHI.   As   a   general   precaution,   remove   any   personally   identifiable 
information (e.g., SSNs, names, addresses, dates of birth, etc...) whenever possible.  The use of ―de-identified‖ or purposeful unidentifiable information should always be used if the 
intent of the issue can be conveyed without including PHI in the e-mail message. 
Section 6J—AHLTA Patient Record Auditing Roles, Capabilities, and Audit Request Processing 
6.17.  AHLTA Audit Program Overview. 6.17.1.  Program Overview:  As a result of recent AHLTA technical advances, the process of 
submitting an audit request to the Military Health System (MHS) Service Desk to determine whether or not an identified AHLTA user may have inappropriately accessed a patient‘s 
―sensitive‖ electronic health record data by invoking a ―break the glass‖ patient encounter audit function is no longer required.  Instead, this unique audit capability is now delegated to 
two  individuals  at  every  Air  Force  MTF.    Each  MTF  Commander  is  responsible  for appointing (in writing) a primary and alternate auditor and granting the necessary  computer 
security access keys to each individual. 6.17.2.  This  delegated  audit  capability  will  benefit  HIPAA  Privacy  and  Security  Officers 
when determining whether an AHLTA user has impermissibly accessed an electronic health record.  Because this new capability allows MTFs to perform their own audits locally, strict 
compliance  with  two  OASD/HA  policy  and  guidance  memorandums  titled,  Patient  Record Auditing  Roles  and  Capabilities,  dated  19  May  2010  and  Guidance  for  Assigning  AHLTA 
Auditors  and  Requesting  an  AHLTA  Audit,  dated  21  Oct  2010,  is  required.    Because  this delegated responsibility allows each MTF to perform their own audits locally, it is essential 
that  strict  oversight  and  control  of  access  be  maintained.    Identified  primary  and  alternate auditors will be required to complete ―Just-in-time‖ training before initiating an audit. 
6.17.3.  Prior to version 3.3.3.2, AHLTA did not have the capability to return audit results for "Read-Only"  access  unless  the  user  had  invoked  the  "Break  the  Glass"  function  on  patient 
encounters  marked  "Sensitive."    Additionally,  MTFs  requesting  an  audit  had  to  submit  a ―trouble‖ ticket to the MHS Service Help Desk for all audit requests.  AHLTA version 3.3 
and higher now provides the ability at the local level to initiate and complete an audit report on  encounters  created  in  version  3.3.  for  "Read-Only"  and  "Break  the  Glass"  access.  This 
----------------Page (318) Break----------------
  320  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
new  localized  audit  report  functionality,  once  exercised,  will  provide  information  on  a specific user‘s access to a patient‘s electronic medical record during a specific time period. 
6.17.4.  Submission of a trouble ticket to the MHS Service Help Desk is no longer required for incidents that have occurred while accessing patient data using an AHLTA 3.3 client (or 
higher).  However, if the requested audit time period included incidents or actions occurring on an earlier AHLTA 838 client, the MTF must submit a trouble ticket to the DHIMS Tier 3 
support office via the MHS Service Help Desk. 6.17.5.  If there is  any  question  as  to  whether  a  patient's  electronic  AHLTA  medical  record 
was accessed using the earlier 838 or later 3.3 version, or if there are multiple MTFs involved in any one investigation, a trouble ticket must be opened with the MHS service help desk. 
6.18.  Appointing Auditors. 6.18.1.  MTF Commanders are required to appoint (in writing) two AHLTA auditors per site, 
one  primary  and  one  alternate  for  whom  each  MTF  systems  administrator  will  assign  the AHLTA patient  electronic record auditing capability or security access ―keys.‖  Only these 
two individuals are authorized to have the Patient and User Audit Report role added to their user account profile.  No one else in the MTF is authorized to perform user access audits of 
patient electronic medical record encounters.  Ensure each individual is fully qualified for the duties for which they will be entrusted.   Ensure  each  auditor has  completed all available or 
required  annual  information  assurance,  information  protection,  resource  protection,  ethics, HIPAA and/or Privacy Act awareness training. 
6.18.2.  Both primary and alternate auditors will be identified on the same appointment letter.  Once the MTF Commander signs the letter, the original document is maintained in the MTF 
HIPAA Privacy Officer‘s office.  Each auditor is provided a copy.  The HIPAA Privacy Officer  will  review  the  letter  annually  ensuring  the  names  of  the  identified  auditors  are 
accurate and correct. 6.18.3.  The  DHIMS  Tier  3  support  office  will  perform  regular  reviews  to  see  which  users 
have been assigned as auditors.  Auditor access keys for any AHLTA user for which the help desk cannot identify as either a primary or alternate auditor, will be removed. 
6.19.  Auditor Training. 6.19.1.  Prior to each approved audit, each auditor will complete ―Just-in-time‖ training.  The 
training  is  computer-based  and  is  provided  via  the  MHS  Learn  website.    Before  an  MTF auditor begins an AHLTA audit of a patient‘s electronic medical record, he or she is required 
to contact officials at the below location to obtain the necessary ―Just-in-time‖ training.  If any  of  the  contact  information  changes,  contact  the  AFMOA  HIPAA  Privacy  Team  for 
assistance with obtaining training. The Office of the Deputy Director of Clinical Documentation

6.20.1.  The  TOPA  Flight  Commander,  the  Patient  Administration  Flight  Commander,  the MTF   Patient   Administration   Officer,   the   MTF   Information   Systems   or   Information 
Management Flight Commander, the MTF Chief of the Medical Staff, and the MTF HIPAA Privacy  and/or  Security  Officers  are  the  only  MTF  officials  authorized  to  request  AHLTA 
user  access  audits.    This  group  is  henceforward  identified  as  the  Electronic  Health  Record (EHR) User Access Audit Review Group. 
6.20.2.  Before  an  audit  may  begin,  an  audit  request  letter  must  be  coordinated  with  the members  of  the  EHR  User  Access  Audit  Review  Group,  then  reviewed  and  approved  in 
writing  by  the  MTF  Commander  or  designee.    The  only  two  authorized  designees  are  the MTF  Chief  of  the  Medical  Staff  (SGH)  and  the  MTF  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer.    If  audit 
approval  authority  is  delegated,  the  designee  authority  must  be  documented  in  writing  on official unit letterhead and maintained in the MTF Commander‘s office.  No more than one 
delegated reviewing/approving authority may be appointed at any given time.  The designee is provided a copy of the approval letter.  If an AHLTA user access audit request is submitted 
by  the  MTF  HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  or  MTF  SGH,  and  if  the  MTF  Commander  has delegated  reviewing/approval  authority  to  either  official,  then  delegation  approval  authority 
is  temporarily suspended  and  the  MTF  Commander  is  required  to  review,  approve,  or disapprove  the  request.    Each  written  audit  request  letter  must  include  the  following 
information: 6.20.2.1.  Patient Internal Entry Number (IEN). 
6.20.2.2.  Provider IEN. 6.20.2.3.  User IEN. 
6.20.2.4.  Date range of suspected violation. 6.20.2.5.  Specific AHLTA electronic medical record area of concern (if applicable or if 
known). 6.20.2.6.  The contact information for the HIPAA Privacy Officer expected to receive the 
audit results. 6.20.2.7.  Justification or reason for the request. 
6.20.3.  Once  the  information  contained  in  the  request  letter  is  validated,  the  audit  request should be approved and then forwarded to one of the AHLTA auditors authorized to perform 
user access audits.  The results of the audit are forwarded to the MTF HIPAA Privacy Officer for analysis.  If an audit requires Tier 3 intervention or analysis, an MHS Service Help Desk 
trouble ticket should be submitted with the same information identified above.  Forward the MHS  trouble  ticket  number  and  case  summary  to  the  AFMS  HIPAA  Privacy  Program 
Manager.  Maintain  all  approved  and  denied  AHLTA  user  access  audit  requests  and  audit results for six years in a locked container in the MTF HIPAA Privacy Officer‘s office.

The primary diagnosis must be specific so that the relationship between the primary condition and the requirement for dental care in the treatment of the primary condition is known.  Dental 
care to improve the general health of the patient is not necessarily adjunctive dental care.

Erroneous Data or Information in AHLTA Legal Correction of Erroneous Data Process Summary 
 Process for Requesting Legal Correction of Erroneous Data or Information within 
AHLTA  
A legal correction of erroneous data is the removal of erroneous PHI information entered into the wrong patient‘s AHLTA encounter. Legal correction of erroneous data should not be requested 
unless erroneous PHI is visible in the wrong patient encounter. The procedure for removing erroneous information not containing PHI is defined later in this document. 
 Detailed steps for requesting legal correction of erroneous data: 
 1.  The patient or provider requests legal correction of erroneous data. 
 2.  The HIPAA Officer reviews the request for appropriateness. Note: If the HIPAA Officer 
denies the request, the requester is notified.  
3.  The request receives a legal review.  
4.  The MTF Commander reviews the request. Note: If the Commander denies the request, the requester is notified. 
 5.  The MTF submits trouble ticket to begin a tracking process. 
 6.  The MTF Commander or designee (e.g., Deputy Commander for Clinical Services (DCCS) or 
HIPAA Privacy Officer) signs a memorandum requesting the legal correction of erroneous data or erroneous PHI and sends the memorandum to the appropriate Chief Clinical Information 
Officer (CIO) within each Service.  Note: The MTF Commander‘s memorandum will contain the MHS trouble ticket number and the MTF Point of Contact (POC). No other personal 
information is needed. A sample letter is attached.  
7.  The CIO or the Clinical Information Services personnel within each Service will review requests and may contact the MTF POC for clarification as needed. If the request is approved, 
the Chief Clinical Information Services Division within each Service will forward the request to Defense Health Information Management System (DHIMS) Program Office for action as 
needed. 
----------------Page (364) Break----------------
  366  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
Note: If the request is denied the CIO will send a denial memorandum to the MTF Commander. 
 8.  DHIMS Program Office tasks the AHLTA Vendor. 
 9.  Tier 3 corrects the information in the AHLTA record as directed.

BREACH REPORTING PROCEDURES 
A20.1.  Overview A20.1.1.  Requirement.  DoD  5400.11-R,  Department  of  Defense  Privacy  Program,  AFI  33-
332,   Air   Force   Privacy   Program,   DoD   6025.18-R   DoD   Health   Information   Privacy Regulation, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, require our 
facilities  to  properly  safeguard  the  confidentiality  of  PII  and  PHI  within  our  control.  Organizational  leadership  must  ensure  a  prompt  and  coordinated  response  is  initiated when 
PII  or  PHI  is  lost,  stolen  or  compromised  within  an  AFMS  organization.    Response procedures  must  limit  or  prevent  further  damage,  assess  the  risk  of  harm  to  the  individuals 
involved, mitigate those risks to the extent possible, and ensure all mandatory reporting and notification  requirements  are  accomplished  to  Air  Force,  DoD,  TRICARE  Management 
Activity  (TMA)  Privacy  Officer,  and  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS) offices   as   appropriate.   These   procedures,   to   include   breaches,   specifically   apply   to 
contractors  under  DoD  5400-11R  and  the  contracting  officer  should  be  engaged  ASAP  for contract compliance issues. 
A20.1.1.1.  Applicability.  The  requirements  and  procedures  outlined  in  this  attachment pertain only to Individually Identifiable Health Information as defined in paragraph 1.2.3. 
below.  Breaches involving non-medical PII (e.g., a unit alpha roster or information from an individual‘s personnel file) must be properly reported through the Host Wing Privacy 
Act Office, but do not require coordination through the AFMS HIPAA team or the TMA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. 
A20.1.2.  Definitions.  It  is  important  to  be  familiar  with,  and  appropriately  apply  the following terms when evaluating potential or actual breaches of information within Air Force 
medical facilities.  There is no differentiation made between paper and electronic documents when considering whether a potential or actual compromise has occurred. 
A20.1.2.1.  Personal  Information  (DoD  5400.11-R,  DL1.14).    Information  about  an individual that identifies, links, relates, or is unique to, or describes him or her, e.g., SSN;

A20.3.1.  Actions   taken   immediately   upon   identifying   a   potential   or   actual   breach. Workforce members that become aware of an actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized 
disclosure,  or  unauthorized  access  to  PII  or  PHI,  in  either  paper  or  electronic  form,  must immediately report the circumstances of the event to the organization‘s  Breach  Response 
Coordinator. A20.3.1.1.  Upon  being  notified  of  a  potential  or  actual  breach,  the  Breach  Response 
Coordinator will evaluate the preliminary facts to determine if an actual or possible loss of  control,  unauthorized  disclosure,  or  unauthorized  access  to  PII  or  PHI  has  occurred.  
Based  on  this  assessment,  the  Breach  Response  Coordinator  will  either  document  the basis for determining no breach has occurred and take no further action, or initiate breach 
response procedures as outlined in paragraph A20.3.2. A20.3.1.2.  When  an  organization  identifies  a  potential  or  actual  compromise  caused by 
another organization, the Breach Response Coordinator of the facility that identified the incident will initiate the following actions: 
A20.3.1.2.1.  Notify the Installation Privacy Act Official. A20.3.1.2.2.  Initiate   a   US-CERT   unless   directed   otherwise   by   the   Installation 
Privacy  Act  Official.    Maintain  a  copy  of  the  US-CERT  and  provide  it  to  the responsible (accountable) organization. 
A20.3.1.2.3.  Notify  leadership  of  the  responsible  (accountable)  organization.    Once notified,  the  accountable  organization  must  assume  full  responsibility  for  resolution 
of the incident. A20.3.2.  Actions   within   one   hour   of   identifying   a   potential   or   actual   breach.   Initial 
notification actions and associated reporting activities occur in rapid sequence, and in some circumstances may occur simultaneously.  Upon determining an actual or possible breach has 
occurred, the Breach Response Coordinator will: A20.3.2.1.  Initiate  a  local  events  log  and  maintain  comprehensive  documentation  of 
dates,  times  and  significant  communications  and  events  throughout  the  duration  of  the incident  resolution.    Retain  hard  copies  of  all  documentation  and  communications 
pertinent to the investigation, mitigation and resolution of the incident. A20.3.2.2.  Initiate  internal  notifications  to  organizational  leadership  IAW  local  policies 
and procedures. A20.3.2.3.  Notify the organization‘s Information Systems Security Officer for incidents 
involving electronic PHI or information systems.  Information Assurance personnel will 
----------------Page (383) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   385  
initiate   simultaneous   incident   response   procedures   while   the   Breach   Response Coordinator continues with breach reporting activities. 
A20.3.2.4.  Initiate and coordinate initial activities to contain the exposure of information and  limit  the  magnitude  of  the  incident.    This  could  be  as  simple  as  securing  loose 
documentation  or  as  complex  as  securing  electronic  information  systems  and  networks. Other  actions  include  securing  physical  evidence  and  evaluating  associated  information 
systems and activities for collateral risks and vulnerabilities. A20.3.2.5.  Contact  the  Installation  Privacy  Act  Official  upon  learning  of  a  breach  to 
provide them with preliminary facts surrounding the incident and to receive guidance on completing  reporting  and  documentation  requirements.    In  cases  where  the  Privacy  Act 
Official  determines  reporting  is  not  required,  fully  document  the  decision  and  maintain the documentation with the case file. In cases where reporting is required, initiate a US-
CERT  notification  at https://forms.us-cert.gov/report.    Print  a  copy  of  the  completed US-CERT  notification  and  document  the  US-CERT  confirmation  number.    Maintain  a 
copy of the US-CERT notification with the events log.  Notification must be completed within one hour of receiving notification of lost, stolen or compromised information. 
A20.3.2.6.  The  Breach  Response  Coordinator  must  work  closely  with  the  Installation Privacy  Act  Official  throughout  the  course  of  incident  to  ensure  all  reporting  and 
individual notification actions are accomplished. A20.3.3.  Actions  Immediately  Following  US-CERT  Notification.  The  Breach  Response 
Coordinator  will  initiate  secondary  notifications  and  mitigation  activities  as  quickly  as practical following notification to US-CERT and the Installation Privacy Official.  Secondary 
notifications and actions include, but may not necessarily be limited to: A20.3.3.1.  If  not  already  aware,  ensure  the  Information  Systems  Security  Officer  is 
notified  of  the  incident.  The  security  team  will  notify  the  servicing  Network  Control Center  (NCC)  and  submit  follow-up  reports  as  necessary  to  meet  established  timelines 
based on the category of incident. A20.3.3.1.1.  The   security   team   may   be   required   to   submit   additional   reports 
depending  on  the  type  of  system  involved  and  whether  the  incident  involved  a confirmed network/system intrusion or changes to Information Operations Condition 
(INFOCON). A20.3.3.2.  Notify the organization‘s appropriate representative(s) for incidents involving 
the  loss  or  suspected  loss  of  a  government  authorized  credit  card  or  financial  data associated with the card. 
A20.3.3.3.  Upon direction  of  organizational  leadership,  notify  the local  Security  Forces or  Office  of  Special  Investigations  (OSI)  if  the  commission  of  a  crime  is  known  or 
suspected. A20.3.3.3.1.  These procedures, to include breaches, specifically apply to contractors 
under DoD 5400-11R, Department of Defense Privacy Program, and the contracting officer should be engaged as soon as possible for contract compliance issues. 
A20.3.3.4.  Conduct  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  incident  and  complete  a  Defense Privacy Office (DPO) Breach Report. The DPO Breach Report must be submitted to the 
----------------Page (384) Break----------------
  386  AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012 
Installation Privacy Act Official as quickly as possible to ensure sufficient lead time for review  and  routing  to  the  Air  Force  Privacy  Office  (SAF/A6PP).    All  DPO  Breach 
Reports must be received by SAF/A6PP within 24 hours of the breach becoming known. A20.3.3.4.1.  The Defense Privacy Office (DPO) Breach Report may be updated and 
re-submitted   as   additional   information   and   follow-up   actions   become   known throughout  the  course  of  the  investigation.    Do  not  delay  submission  of  the  initial 
report while gathering additional information. A20.3.3.4.2.  A  template  for  the  DPO  Breach  Report  may  be  obtained  from  the 
Installation Privacy Act Official or from the TRICARE Management Activity Privacy Office                                                        website                                                        at:  
http://www.tricare.mil/tma/privacy/downloads/TMA%20Breach%20Reporting%20Form.doc.  (Web link subject to change). 
A20.3.3.4.3.  For  the  most  part,  completing  the  DPO  Breach  Report  is  a  matter  of filling in blank data fields and checking appropriate boxes.  There are however certain 
areas such as Item Number 8 (description of the breach) and Item Number 9 (actions taken in response to the breach) that require narrative input.  It is very important that 
these  two  items  provide  as  many  relevant  facts  as  possible.    Specifically,  Item Number 8 should paint a clear picture of the circumstances involved in the incident, 
e.g., the ―who, what, when, where and why,‖ and Item Number 9 should describe exactly  what  steps  or  action(s)  are  being  (or  will  be)  implemented  to  correct  and 
mitigate the incident and prevent similar recurrences. A20.3.3.5.  Notify            the            AFMOA/SGAT            HIPAA            team            at 
AFMOAHIPAATRAINING@US.AF.MIL or      respective      AFMOA      HIPAA representative  in  an  unencrypted  e-mail  message,  marked  FOUO,  that  a  US-CERT  has 
been initiated.   Place ―FOUO: US-CERT Notification‖ in the subject line.  Include the following information with the message: 
A20.3.3.5.1.  Name of organization and POC (Breach Response Coordinator). A20.3.3.5.2.  A  completed  copy  of  the  preliminary  Defense  Privacy  Office  (DPO) 
Breach Report. A20.3.4.  Investigation and Risk Assessment. All incidents involving the compromise of PII 
and  PHI  must  be  thoroughly  investigated  to  determine  the  circumstances  which  lead  to  the incident,  and  assess  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  the  incident.  Minor  incidents  may  be 
easily  investigated  and  resolved  by  the  Breach  Response  Coordinator  alone,  whereas  more complex or sensitive incidents may necessitate the activation of the organization‘s MISRT or 
appointment  of  an  investigating  officer.    Guidance  from  SMEs  such  as  the  SJA  and  Public Affairs should be solicited as necessary. 
A20.3.4.1.  Information  gathered  during  the  investigation  of  the  incident  should  be thoroughly   documented.      When   circumstances   warrant,   complete   and   submit   a 
supplemental  Defense  Privacy  Office  (DPO)  Breach  Report  to  the  Installation  Privacy Act  Official  and  AFMOA/SGAT  HIPAA  team  following  the  procedures  described  in 
paragraph 3.3.5.  Ensure updated information within supplemental reports is documented in red font and that item #3 and #3a of the report are updated accordingly. 
----------------Page (385) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   387  
A20.3.4.2.  With the facts of the incident known, the Breach Response Coordinator will assess  the  risk  of harm  to  affected  individuals  as  a  result  of  the  breach  and  make  a 
recommendation  to  organizational  leadership  regarding  the  need  to  notify  affected individuals of the compromise. The risk assessment will be conducted using the OSD and 
HHS  Risk  Assessment  criteria  as  shown  in  Table  1  of  this  attachment.    The  Breach Response   Coordinator   will   consult   with   the   Installation   Privacy   Act   Official, 
AFMOA/SGAT HIPAA team, and legal counsel as necessary for questions pertaining to the risk assessment and recommended findings. 
A20.3.4.2.1.  Organizational  leadership  will  assess  the  results  of  the  risk  assessment and recommendations of the Installation Privacy Act Official in determining whether 
affected  individuals  should  be  notified  of  the  breach.  When  assessing  risk  level, leadership should bear in mind that notification when there is little or no risk of harm 
might  create  unnecessary  concern  or  confusion.    The  Breach  Response  Coordinator must thoroughly document the circumstances of all breaches and the decisions made 
relative   to   each   of   the   factors   identified   in   the   risk   assessment   table;   the documentation   must   clearly   demonstrate   the   rationale   behind   the   notification 
determination. A20.3.5.  Notification Procedures to Affected Individuals. 
A20.3.5.1.  Notification  required.  When  notification  is  deemed  appropriate,  the  Breach Response Coordinator will ensure notification letters are prepared in accordance with the 
template provided in DoD 5400.11-R, paragraph C1.5.1.5 and DoD 5400.11-R, Appendix 2. 
A20.3.5.1.1.  Forward  a  final  draft  of  the  proposed  letter  to  the  Installation  Privacy Act Official for review and approval before mailing to affected individuals. 
A20.3.5.1.2.  Notification  letters  must  be  mailed  within  ten  (10)  days of  identifying the     affected     individuals.          Letters     will     be     endorsed     by     the     Group 
Commander/organizational  equivalent  or  above,  and  delivered  by  first  class  mail. Refer  to  DoD  5400.11-R,  paragraph  C1.5.1.2.3  for  alternative  means  of  notification 
when use of mail is impractical. A20.3.5.1.3.  Additional  reporting  requirements  are  necessary  in  instances  when 
notification  letters  are  required,  but  not  delivered  within  the  ten  (10)  day  time requirement.   In   these   cases   the   Breach   Response   Coordinator   will prepare   a 
memorandum  signed  by  the  organization‘s  Group  Commander/organizational equivalent  or  above,  addressed  to  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  explaining  the 
circumstances  of  the  delay.    Forward  the  signed  memorandum  to  the  Installation Privacy Act Official for submission SAF/A6PP and DoD. 
A20.3.5.2.  Notification  not  required.  In  cases  where  notification  to  affected  individuals is determined to be unnecessary, the Breach Response Coordinator must fully document 
the rationale for not providing notification to affected individuals; the burden of proof for not notifying affected individuals rests with the organization. 
A20.3.5.3.  Law  Enforcement  may  request  a  delay  in  notification  in  situations  where making  notification  would  impede  a  criminal  investigation.  Follow  procedures  in  DoD 
5400.11-R C1.5.1.4.1. for responding to law enforcement requests to delay notification.

A20.4.  Special Considerations Regarding HHA Breach Reporting A20.4.1.  Process  Overview.  The  TMA  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Office  is  the  AFMS 
central  point  of  contact  for  evaluating  and  assisting  in  the  reporting  of  breaches  of unprotected  health  information  to  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS). 
TMA receives initial notification of a potential or actual breach via the DoD breach reporting guidelines as described in paragraph 2.7.1. 
A20.4.1.1.  The TMA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office will review the Defense Privacy Office Breach Report submitted by AFMSA/SG3SA and make a determination regarding 
whether  the  incident  qualifies  as  a  breach  for  purposes  of  notification  to  HHS.      When required,  TMA  will  make  necessary  notifications  to  HHS  and  inform  AFMSA/SG3SA 
that the notification was made. A20.4.2.  Notification  Required.  The  Breach  Response  Coordinator  will  ensure  notification 
letters  are  prepared.    DoD  breach  notification  requirements  are  more  stringent  than  HHS requirements,  therefore,  in  cases  where  notification  is  deemed  appropriate  under  HHS 
guidelines,  the  notification will  have  also  been  required  under  DoD  requirements.    The content of the DoD notification template is generally sufficient for HHS purposes, provided 
the following two additional elements are incorporated into the letter: A20.4.2.1.  The date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known. 
A20.4.2.2.  The  contact  procedures  for  the  recipient  to  ask  questions  or  learn  additional information.    This  information  must  include  a  toll  free  telephone  number,  an  e-mail 
address, Web site, or postal address. A20.4.3.  Delivery of Notification Letters.  Letters are required to be delivered to individuals 
within 60 days by HHS standards for HIPAA related incidents, but the more stringent DoD notification requirement  of 10 days  for Privacy  Act incidents takes precedence.  Letters will 
be endorsed by the organization‘s Group Commander/organizational equivalent or above, and  delivered  by  first  class  mail.  In  cases  where  the  individual  is  deceased,  deliver 
notification to the Next of Kin (NOK) or personal representative if their address is known. A20.4.4.  Alternative Procedures When Letters Cannot Be Sent.  When insufficient or out-of-
date contact information precludes written notification to the individual, a substitute form of notice reasonably calculated to reach the individual may be used. 
A20.4.4.1.  When  the  number  of  individuals  that  cannot  be  contacted  is  fewer  than  ten, the substitute notice may be provided by an alternative form of written notice, telephone, 
or other means. A20.4.4.2.  When the number of individuals that cannot be contacted is ten or more, the 
substitute notice  must  be  in  the form  of  either a  conspicuous  posting  for  a  period  of  90 days on the home page of the website of the organization involved, or conspicuous notice 
in major print or broadcast media in geographic  areas  where the individuals affected by the breach likely reside. The substitute notice must also include a toll-free phone number 
that  remains  active  for  at  least  90  days where  an  individual  can  learn  whether  the individual‘s unsecured PHI may be included in the breach. 
A20.4.4.2.1.  Activation   of   a   toll-free   number   and   associated   costs   are   the responsibility of the affected organization.

Table A20.1.  OSD-HHS Risk Assessment Criteria. 
# OSD FACTOR HHS FACTOR RISK EXAMPLES - CONSIDERATIONS 
1 
Evaluate the nature of the data elements 
breached and the type of PII involved 
Evaluate the nature and extent 
of the PHI involved; the 
types of identifiers, and the 
likelihood of re-identification. 
  
a. Name only Low 
Consideration needs to be given to unique names; those where one or 
only a few in the population may have or those that could readily identify an 
individual (such as a public figure) 
b. Name plus one or more personal identifiers such as demographic 
information                         (not SSN, medical or financial data) Moderate 
Additional identifiers include date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, 
biometric record and any other information that can be linked or is 
linkable to an individual 
c. SSN High SSN includes truncated or partially masked  
d. Name plus SSN High  
e. Name plus medical or financial data High  
2 Number of individuals affected NA 
The number of individuals affected is a determining factor in how 
notifications are made, not whether they are made 
3 What is the likelihood the Whether the PHI was actually   
----------------Page (389) Break----------------
AFI41-210  6 JUNE 2012   391  
information is accessible and 
usable? What level of protection 
applied to the information? 
acquired or viewed 
a. Encryption Used                                               DOD: (FIPS 140-2)     HHS: (Applicable 
NIST) Low 
Data at rest or in motion is properly encrypted and unable to be viewed or 
used 
b. Password only Moderate to High The level of risk must be determined in context to the type of data in factor #1 
c. No protection High Loose paperwork or unencrypted data 
4 Likelihood the breach may lead to harm Status of the unauthorized user or recipient Low Moderate  High 
The determination is made in consideration of the type of breach 
and the type(s) of data involved For HHS purposes, consider whether 
the unauthorized recipient has an obligation to protect the information 
(PA, HIPAA, etc) 
5 
Ability of the Agency 
(organization) to mitigate the risk of 
harm 
The extent to which the risk to 
the PHI has been mitigated   
a. Loss High Evidence exists that PII has been lost and is no longer under DOD control 
b. Theft High Evidence shows that PII has been stolen and could possibly be used to commit ID theft 
c. Compromise within DOD control Low    High Low: No evidence of malicious intent                              High: Evidence or possibility of malicious intent 
d. Compromise beyond DOD control High Possibility that PII could be used with malicious intent or to commit ID theft
