PA Tax Return (PA-40). To the best of my knowledge, my return is true and complete. I consent my return and accompanying schedules and statements may be sent to the Internal 
I declare I have received the above-named taxpayer’s return and the entries on this form are complete and correct to the best of my knowledge. I obtained the taxpayer’s signature on
this form before submitting this return to the PA Department of Revenue. I provided the taxpayer with a copy of all forms and information to be filed with the IRS and the PA Department
of Revenue and followed all other requirements specified by the PA Department of Revenue and described in the IRS Publication 1345, Handbook for Electronic Filers of Individual Tax
Returns (Tax Year 2013). If I am the preparer, under penalty of perjury I declare I examined the above-named taxpayer’s return and accompanying schedules and statements, and to
the best of my knowledge, they are true and complete. I understand I am required to keep this form and supporting documents for three years.
Primary Taxpayer’s First Name, Initial 
Secondary Taxpayer’s Last Name (only if different)
Final Return
consent for my refund to be directly deposited as designated in Part II and declare all information shown on Lines 6 through 8 is correct. I certify 
the ultimate destination of the funds is within the U.S. or one of its territories. If I have filed a joint return, this is an irrevocable appointment of 
the other Taxpayer as an agent to receive the refund.
I authorize the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and its designated financial agents to initiate an electronic funds withdrawal entry to my 
designated account for Pennsylvania taxes owed. I also authorize my financial institution to debit the entry to my account and the financial 
institutions involved in the processing of my electronic payment of taxes to receive confidential information necessary to answer inquiries and 
resolve issues related to my payment. I certify the funds for this withdraw are originating from an account within the U.S. or one of its territories. 
I may revoke this authorization by notifying the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue no later than two business days prior to the payment (settlement)
 
date. I understand notification must be made in writing by email to ra-achrevok@state.pa.us or fax to 717-772-9310.
If I have filed a balance-due return, I understand that if the PA Department of Revenue does not receive full and timely payment of my tax liability, I will remain liable for the tax 
and all applicable interest and penalties. If I have filed a joint federal and state tax return and there is an error on my state return, I understand my federal return will be rejected.
I declare under penalties of perjury compared the information on my return with the information I provided to my electronic return originator and the amounts match those on my 
2013 RevenueService (IRS) by my electronic return originator, and subsequently by the IRS to the PA Department of Revenue. If I am filing from a home computer, I understand I 
am required to keep this form and supporting documents for three years.
