Computation:  Using the amount on Line 3 of Form D-40, find the correct Earned Income Credit (EIC) amount from the EIC table in the 
Federal 1040 tax return booklet. Multiply that amount by .40 to determine the DC Non-Custodial Parent EITC amount to claim on Schedule U, 
Part 1b, Line 1. If you are a part-year filer, see part-year resident instructions in the D-40 booklet on prorating the credit to be claimed.
