Reasons for Filing. 
Check applicable boxes. If none apply,
 do not 
file Form 2210.
A
You request a
 waiver 
(see instructions) of your entire penalty. You must check this box and file page 1 of Form 2210, but you
are not required to figure your penalty.
B
You request a 
waiver
 (see instructions) of part of your penalty. You must figure your penalty and waiver amount and file Form
2210.
C
Your income varied during the year and your penalty is reduced or eliminated when figured using the 
annualized
 
income 
installment method. 
You must figure the penalty using Schedule Al and file Form 2210.
D
Your penalty is lower when figured by treating the federal income tax withheld from your income as paid on the dates it was 
actually withheld, instead of in equal amounts on the payment due dates. You must figure your penalty and file Form 2210.
E
You filed or are filing a joint return for either 2012 or 2013, but not for both years, and line 8 above is smaller than line 5
above. You must file page 1 of Form 2210, but you are 
not
 required to figure your penalty (unless box 
B,
 
C,
 or 
D 
applies).

Part III
Short Method
Can You Use the 
Short Method?
You may use the short method if:
•  You made no estimated tax payments (or your only payments were withheld 
federal income tax), 
or
•  You paid the same amount of estimated tax on each of the four payment 
due dates.
Must You Use the 
Regular Method?
You must use the regular method (Part IV) instead of the short method if:
•  You made any estimated tax payments late,
•  You checked box 
C
 or 
D
 in Part II, 
or
•  You are filing Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ and you did not receive wages 
as an employee subject to U.S. income tax withholding.
Note:  
If any payment was made earlier than the due date, you may use the short method, but using it may cause
 
you to pay a 
larger penalty than the regular method. If the payment was only a few days early, the difference is
 
likely to be small.
